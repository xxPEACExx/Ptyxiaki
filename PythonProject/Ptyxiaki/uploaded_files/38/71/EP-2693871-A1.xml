Specifically, the disclosure relates to apparatuses for dissemination of plant treatment agents by insects. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">BACKGROUND </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">[0003] United States patent no. 5,348,5 1 (Gross et al.) purports to disclose biocontroi agents that are disseminated for the control of pests by Apis mellifera L. using a device inserted into a modified down-sized super which is integrated as a substructure of a conventional, commercial beehive. The device provides separate entry and departure pathways which allows exiting bees to be surface-contaminated with the biocontroi agent as they exit the hive. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> [0004] United States patent no. 5,189,100 (Kovach) purports to disclose a bee dissemination device or dispenser that is non destructive to the hive, is easy to insert, refill, and remove, and includes a cartridge insertable in a housing. The device is designed to be used by a non professional bee keeper, such as a grower. It is inserted into the entrance of a standard bee hive with minimal disruption to the hive or colony. When the bees exit the hive, they walk up a ramp through a dry biological control suspension and leave the hive, carrying and depositing the biological control agent onto the flowers as they pollinate the crop. When the biological control agent runs low, additional material is added easily by lifting a hinged lid or replacing the old

 cartridge with a filled one. The lid also provides some moisture protection to keep the biological agent dry, thereby facilitating bee inoculation. The dispenser is removed by simply pulling it from the hive entrance when pollination activities are completed. The removal is non disruptive and does not destroy the integrity of the hive. When the device is inserted, refilled, or removed at night, minimal protective clothing is required by the user. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> [0005] PCT patent application publication no.

The bee domicile 100 includes a domicile body 102, the interior of which may be colonized by a bumble bee colony, or a 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 colony of another type of bee. A domicile lid 104 is removably receivable on the domicile body 102. </p><p id="p0048" num="0048"> [0045] Referring to Figure 2, in the example shown, the domicile body 102 includes an entrance port 106 and an exit port 108, through which bees enter and exit the domicile 100, respectively. An entrance/exit assembly 110 is mountable to the entrance port 106 and the exit port 108. The entrance/exit assembly includes an entrance conduit 1 12, which is mountable to the entrance port 106 and extends inwardly into the body 102. The entrance/exit assembly 0 further includes an exit conduit 114, which is mountable to the exit port 108 and extends outwardly from the body 102. Both the entrance conduit 112 and the exit conduit 114 are generally frustoconcial. The entrance conduit 1 12 tapers in cross sectional area going in a direction away from the entrance port 106 and into the domicile body 102, and the exit conduit 114 tapers in cross sectional area going in a direction away from the exit port 108 and away from the domicile body 102. This tapering may encourage bees to enter the bee domicile 100 through the entrance port 106 rather than through the exit port 108, and to exit the bee domicile 100 through the exit port 108 rather than through the entrance port 106. Particularly, when approaching the domicile 100 from the exterior, the bee is more likely to enter the entrance conduit 112, as the opening to the entrance conduit 112 is larger than the opening to the exit conduit 114. </p><p id="p0049" num="0049"> [0046] Referring to Figures 2 and 3, in the example shown, the domicile lid 104 includes a downwardly extending receptacle 116, which is integrally formed with the domicile lid 104. An openable receptacle lid 103 (also referred to as an openable lid 103) is pivotably mounted to the domicile lid 104, and is pivotable between an open position, shown in Figure 3, and a closed position, shown in Figure 1. </p><p id="p0050" num="0050"> [0047] Referring still to Figures 2 and 3, in the example shown, both the domicile lid 104 and the receptacle lid 103 include at least one vent 119, so that the domicile body 102 and the receptacle 116 are vented to the outside environment. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
 [0048] Referring still to Figures 2 and 3, in the example shown, the receptacle 116 includes a receptacle entrance port 118, which opens into the domicile body 102, and through which bees may enter the receptacle 116 from the domicile body 102. The receptacle 116 further includes a receptacle exit port 120, through which bees may exit the receptacle 116. The receptacle exit port 120 is aligned with the exit port 108 of the body 102. In order to exit the domicile 100, bees travel along exit path 17, which passes from the domicile body 102 and into the receptacle 116 via the receptacle entrance port 1 18, through the receptacle 116, out of the receptacle 116 through the receptacle exit port 120, into the exit conduit 1 4 via the exit port 108, and out of the exit conduit 114. </p><p id="p0051" num="0051"> [0049] Referring to Figures 2 to 4, in the example shown, a tray 122 containing a powdered plant treatment formulation is receivable in the receptacle 116, so that the tray 122 and the plant treatment formulation are positioned in the exit path 1 17. As will be described in further detail below, bees passing through the receptacle 116 are encouraged to walk through the plant treatment formulation, so that the plant treatment formulation may be picked up by and cling to the bees, for delivery to a target plant, for example when the bees pollinate a target plant. </p><p id="p0052" num="0052"> [0050] The tray may be made from a plastic, and may be of a one- piece construction. Further, the tray may be moisture impermeable, and light impermeable. This may help to prolong the sheif life of the plant treatment formulation. </p><p id="p0053" num="0053"> [0051] Referring still to Figures 2 to 4, in the example shown, the tray 122 is removably receivable in the receptacle 116, and may be placed into the receptacle 116 and removed from the receptacle 116 when the receptacle lid 103 is open. In alternate examples, the tray 122 may be integral with or permanently mounted to the bee domicile 100. For example, the tray 122 may be integrally formed in the receptacle 116, and may be refilled when the receptacle lid 03 is open. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
 [0052] Referring to Figure 5, in the example shown, the tray 122 includes a bee entrance end 128 that is positioned adjacent the receptacle entrance port 118 when the tray 122 is received in the receptacle 116, and a bee exit end 130 that is positioned adjacent the receptacle exit port 120 when the tray 122 is received in the receptacle 116. A longitudinal axis 31 of the tray 122 extends between the bee entrance end 128 and the bee exit end 130. In the example shown, the bee entrance end 128 and bee exit end 130 are substantially identical, and the tray 122 is generally symmetrical, so that the tray 122 may be inserted into the receptacle 1 6 in either of two orientations. </p><p id="p0054" num="0054"> [0053] Referring still to Figure 5, in the example shown, the tray further includes a base 124, and at least one side wall 126 extending upwardly from the base 124 and surrounding a periphery of the base 124. In the example shown, the tray 122 is generally rectangular, and includes four sidewalls 126, namely a pair of spaced apart walls 126a, 126b extending lengthwise between the bee entrance end 128 and bee exit end 130, and a pair of spaced apart walls 26c, 126d, extending widthwise along the bee entrance end 128 and bee exit end 130, respectively. The sidewalls 126 define an upper rim 132. </p><p id="p0055" num="0055"> [0054] In use, the powdered plant treatment formulation may be provided as a layer on the base 124, and be contained by the sidewalls 126. The plant treatment formulation may have an initial depth on the base, i.e. a depth when the layer is first provided on the base, before depletion by the bees. In some examples, the initial depth of the plant treatment formulation on the base 124 may be selected such that: </p><p id="p0056" num="0056"> (1 ) The initial depth is less than a spiracle height of the bees. Spiracle height may be defined as the distance from a surface upon which a bee is walking to the lowermost spiracle of the bee. By selecting the initial depth to be less than a spiracle height of the bees, the powder generally does not block the spiracles of the bees, and generally does not interfere with respiration of the bees. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
 (2) A depletion time of the layer corresponds to a shelf life of the plant treatment formulation. After the plant treatment formulation is first accessed by the bees (for example when the tray is first placed in the receptacle), it becomes depleted as the bees pick up the plant treatment formulation. After a certain amount of time, it becomes depleted to the point where the plant treatment formulation is no longer picked up by the bees in a sufficient amount to benefit the target crop. The time from when the plant treatment formulation is first accessed by the bees to the time the plant treatment formulation becomes depleted is referred to as the depletion time. Further, the plant treatment formulation generally has a shelf life. For example, as will be described below, the tray may initially be provided sealed with a removable top. The top may be removed prior to inserting the tray into the receptacle. After the top is removed, the plant treatment formulation may have a certain shelf life. For example, after the shelf life expires, the plant treatment formulation may have a decreased ability to benefit plants, may have a decreased ability to be picked up by bees, or may begin to degrade. In order to prevent wasting of the plant treatment formulation, the initial depth of the layer may be selected such that the depletion time of the layer corresponds to the shelf life of the plant treatment formulation. In some examples, the shelf life of the plant treatment formulation may be less than 10 days, for example between 4 days and about 5 days. The exact shelf life may depend on various factors, such as the composition of the formulation, and the ambient humidity and temperature. </p><p id="p0057" num="0057"> In some examples, in order to meet the above requirements, the initial depth may be selected to be between about 2 mm and about 4 mm. </p><p id="p0058" num="0058"> [0055] The tray 122 may optionally be sold pre-filled with the plant treatment formulation, so that when the plant treatment formulation is spent (for example after several days), the tray 122 may be removed and discarded and replaced with a fresh tray. In such examples, the tray 122 may include a removable top (not shown) sealed to the upper rim 132. The removable top may be a metal foil, which may be heat-sealed to the upper rim 132, and 
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"/>-->
 which may be peeled off by a user prior to insertion into the receptacle 116. The removable top may be light impermeable and moisture impermeable, in order to maintain the freshness and efficacy of the plant treatment formulation. </p><p id="p0059" num="0059"> [0056] In some examples, the removable top may carry a net positive electrostatic charge. As will be described further below, the plant treatment formulation may include a positively charged component. The positively charged component in the plant treatment formulation and the removable top may repel each other, so that the plant treatment formulation does not stick to the removable top. </p><p id="p0060" num="0060"> [0057] Referring still to Figure 5, in the example shown, the sidewall</p><p id="p0061" num="0061">126c defines a first set of steps 134 leading downwardly to the base 124 at the bee entrance end 128, and the sidewall 126d defines a second set of steps 136 leading upwardly from the base 124 at the bee exit end 130. The first 134 and second 136 sets of steps may aid the bees in entering and exiting the tray 122. In alternate examples, a bee entrance end and/or bee exit end may include a ramp or ladder to aid the bees in entering and/or exiting the tray. </p><p id="p0062" num="0062"> [0058] Referring still to Figure 5, in the example shown, the tray 122 includes a plurality of posts 138 extending upwardly from the base 124, and positioned between the bee entrance end 128 and bee exit end 130. The posts act as obstacles around which the bees walk to reach the bee exit end 130 from the bee entrance end 128. In the example shown, the posts 138 are positioned such that they are generally staggered, so that there is no straight path parallel to axis 131 along which the bees can walk from the bee entrance end 128 to the bee exit end 130. This increases the length of the path the bees take between the bee entrance end 128 and the bee exit end 130, which increases the amount of plant treatment formulation picked up by the bees when passing through the tray 122. In addition, this encourages the bees to take different paths through the tray 122, which helps to keep the powder evenly distributed and not packed down in a track. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="14"/>-->
 [0059] Referring still to Figure 5, in the example shown, the posts 138 are generally circular in cross-section. In alternate examples, posts may be another shape in cross-section, such as square. </p><p id="p0063" num="0063"> [0060] Referring still to Figure 5, in the example shown, each post 138 has a top end 140 and an opposed bottom end 142 at the base 124, and each post 138 is radiused at the bottom end 142. The radiused portion extends between the post 138 and the base 124. The radiused portions can help to reduce building up and packing down of plant treatment at the bottom ends 42 of the posts 38. </p><p id="p0064" num="0064"> [0061] Referring still to Figure 5, in the example shown, the tray 122 may further include at least one obstruction extending inwardly from the sidewalls 126 and upwardly from the base 124. Referring to Figure 5, in the example shown, the tray 122 includes two obstructions 144a, 144b, extending inwardly from sidewall 126a, and two obstructions 144c, 144d, extending inwardly from sidewall 126b. The obstructions extend generally inwardly from the sidewalls 126 towards the longitudinal axis 131 of the tray 122. The obstructions 144 may generally serve to discourage the bees from walking in a straight line from the bee entrance end 128 to the bee exit end 130 along the sidewalls 126a, 126b, and to encourage the bees to walk amongst and around the posts 138. Again, this increases the length of the path the bees take between the bee entrance end 128 and the bee exit end 130, and encourages the bees to take different paths through the tray 122. </p><p id="p0065" num="0065"> [0062] As mentioned above, the receptacle lid 103 covers the receptacle 116, and also the tray 122. Referring back to Figure 4, in the example shown, the receptacle lid 103 and the tray 122 cooperate to encourage the bees to walk along the base 124 of the tray 122 and through the powder, rather than flying through the receptacle 116. Specifically, the receptacle lid 103 is positioned above the sidewalls 26, and includes at least one downwardly extending barrier wall 146. In the example shown, the receptacle lid 103 includes a plurality of downwardly extending barrier walls 146. The barrier walls 146 extend across the receptacle lid 103 in a direction 
<!-- EPO <DP n="15"/>-->
 transverse to the longitudinal axis 131 of the tray 122 (when the tray is received in the receptacle). The barrier walls 146 have a top end 48 and a bottom end 150, and a height extending therebetween. The height of the barrier walls 146 is selected so that for the duration of the depletion time, the distance between the bottom ends 50 of the barrier walls 146 and the layer of powder on the base is generally too small for a bee to fly between. The distance between the bottom ends 150 of the barrier walls 146 and the layer of powder on the base may also be referred to herein as the vertical clearance of the exit pathway. For example, the vertical clearance may be less than 1 inch, and more specifically less than 0.75 inches. In one particular example, the height of the tray 122 is about 0.75 inches, the barrier walls 146 extend to the top of the tray 122, and the initial depth of the layer is 2-4 mm (0.08 to 0.16 inches. In this particular example, the vertical clearance is between about 0.59 inches and 0.67 inches. This may generally encourage the bees to walk along the base 124 of the tray 22. </p><p id="p0066" num="0066"> [0063] In alternate examples, the bees may be encouraged to walk along the base 124 of the tray 122 and through the powder in another manner. For example, the height of the receptacle 116 may be selected so that the distance between the top ends 140 of the posts 138 and the receptacle lid 117 is generally too small for a bee to fly between. </p><p id="p0067" num="0067"> [0064] In the example shown, the barrier walls 146 additionally serve to discourage the bees from walking upside down along an interior surface of the receptacle lid 103 and thereby avoid the powder altogether. </p><p id="p0068" num="0068"> [0065] Referring back to Figures 1 and 2, in the example shown, the domicile 100 further includes a door 154, which may be opened and closed to block and unblock the receptacle entrance port 8, to selectively allow or prevent access to the receptacle 116 by the bees. For example, when replacing tray 122 with a fresh tray, it may be desirable to close the door 154 prior to opening the receptacle lid 103, so that when receptacle lid 103 is open, bees cannot exit the domicile 100 via the open receptacle lid 103. In Figure 1 , the door 154 is shown in a closed position. In order to open the door 
<!-- EPO <DP n="16"/>-->
 154, it may be pulled upwardly, and then pivoted rearwardly so that it rests on the domicile lid 104. </p><p id="p0069" num="0069"> [0066] In the example shown, the receptacle 116 and the tray 122 (when received in the receptacle 116) are internal to the domicile 100.

The top wall 958, bottom wall 960, and side walls 962, 964 define a front opening 965 opposed to the rear wall 956. A removable door 957 (shown in Figure 9) is mountable to the receptacle 916 over the front opening 965.

 Referring still to Figures 7 and 8, the exit board includes an upper surface 220. When the exit board 216 is received in the bottom board 204, the upper surface 220 is spaced vertically below the super 202, and a gap 222 is defined between the upper surface 220 and the super 202. The exit board 216 further includes a downwardly extending recess 224 (also rererred to as a receptacle) positioned forwardly of the upper surface 220. An openable lid 226 is mounted over the recess 224, and includes at least one bee entrance port 228 positioned adjacent the upper surface 220 when the lid 226 is mounted over the recess 224, and at least one bee exit port 230 positioned adjacent the bottom board opening 212 when the lid is mounted over the recess 224. When the lid 226 is mounted over the recess 224 and the exit board 216 is received in the bottom board 204, the lid 226 is positioned closely to the super 202, so that bees generally may not fly between the lid 226 and the super 202. In order to exit the bee domicile 200, bees may pass from the super 202 to the region of the upper surface 220, and may then walk along the upper surface 220 or fly in the gap 222 towards the recess 224. Bees may then enter the recess 224 via the bee entrance ports 228, pass through the recess 224, exit the recess 224 via the bee exit ports 230, and pass through the bottom board opening 212. </p><p id="p0082" num="0082"> [0079] Referring still to Figures 7 and 8, a tray 232 is receivable in the recess 224, so that it is positioned in the exit pathway 217, and through which the bees may walk to reach the opening 212 from the at least one super 202. The tray 232 is similar to the tray 122 described above with reference to Figures 1 to 4, and is configured to receive a powdered plant treatment agent. As described above with reference to tray 122, bees passing through the recess 224 are encouraged to walk through the plant treatment formulation housed in the tray 232, so that the plant treatment formulation is picked up by and clings to the bees, and is delivered to a target plant when the bees pollinate a target plant. </p><p id="p0083" num="0083"> [0080] When the plant treatment formulation in the tray 232 is spent, the exit board 216 may be slid out of the bottom board 204 through the

 opening 212, the lid 226 may be removed from the recess 224, and the tray 232 may be removed from the recess 224 and replaced with a fresh tray. Alternately, the tray 232 may be refilled. </p><p id="p0084" num="0084"> [0081] Similarly to the receptacle lid 103 described above with reference to Figures 1 to 4, the lid 226 includes downwardly extending barrier walls 234, which cooperate with the tray 232 to discourage the bees from flying through the tray 232 and encourage the bees to walk through the powder. In this example, the vertical clearance may be less than 1 inch, more specifically less than 0.875 inches. In one particular example, the vertical clearance may be about 0.715 inches and about 0.795 inches. </p><p id="p0085" num="0085"> [0082] The trays 122 and 232 may house any suitable powder formulation for the treatment of plants. Suitable formulations may generally include a plant treatment agent (i.e. an agent that is beneficial to a crop), and one or more additives.
