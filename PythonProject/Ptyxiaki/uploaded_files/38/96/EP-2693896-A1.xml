Cocoa products including, without limitation, cocoa powders and cocoa liquors produced according to such methods are also disclosed, as well as food products including such cocoa products. BACKGROUND ART </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> [0002] Cocoa bean processing includes fermenting harvested beans, drying the beans, de-hulling the beans to produce nibs, sterilizing the nibs, roasting the nibs, crushing the nibs into cocoa liquor, and optionally pressing the cocoa liquor to obtain cocoa butter and cocoa powder. Variations in this process also are known. Dutched cocoa powder is produced by alkalizing the nibs prior to roasting. Alkalization is a process where nibs are heated in water in the presence of sodium, potassium, ammonium, or magnesium hydroxide or carbonate, for example and without limitation, potash (K2CO3). The alkalization process alters the flavor, coloring, and solubility of the cocoa powder in water. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> [0003] Current commercial demands require a cocoa manufacturer to produce cocoa products in a broad palette of colors, flavors, or both. While each manufacturer understands that manipulation of processing conditions such as temperature, water content, duration of processing time, and pH will affect the color and flavor of the cocoa powder produced, there is no general consensus as to how to produce a cocoa product of a consistently desirable color, flavor, or both. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> [0004] US Patent Application Publication US 2008 / 0107783 describes methods of producing bright red, brown, and red-brown cocoa products.

The fruity flavored cocoa products may have an L color co-ordinate value greater than 16 or in a range of 22-29, a pH less than 7.0 or in a range of 3.0-6.0, and exhibit a high brightness expressed by a C color coordinate value greater than 20 or in a range of 23-30. H-values (CIE 1976) may fall in the red-to-brown range of between 35-55. </p><p id="p0056" num="0056"> [0047] A number of objective methods for measuring the color of cocoa products are known. In one method, the Hunter color system or CIE 1976 (CIELAB) and like systems, color may be described in terms of three parameters: Lightness (L)~the light or dark aspect of a color, where the lower the L-value, the darker the cocoa powder will appear; Chroma (C)-the intensity of a color by which one distinguishes a bright or gray color, where the higher the C- value, the brighter the powder will be; and Hue (H)~ referring to color in daily speech, such as red, yellow, or blue. For cocoa powders, a low H value indicates a red color and a high H-value indicates a brown color. </p><p id="p0057" num="0057"> [0048] The CIE 1976 color system describes colors in terms of coordinates L, "a*" and "b*". The L coordinate is consistent with the Value of Lightness, and from the a* and b* coordinates, the Chroma and Hue can be calculated as follows: C*= {square root over (a*<sup>2</sup>+b*<sup>2</sup>)}; H=arctan(b*/a*). </p><p id="p0058" num="0058"> [0049] The spectral color is the result of the source of light and the reflecting surface. For a good reproducible measurement of color, the source of light is standardized. There are two basic approaches for measuring color: visually or by instrumentation. There is a natural human tendency to trust only "one's own eyes." For this reason, colors are still frequently judged visually. To be able to do this in a reproducible manner, certain standard conditions should be met: the light source, for example and without hmitation, a CIE standard light source; the positions of the sample, relative to the light source, which are preferably at an angle of 45° to each other; the background of the sample, uniform and preferably gray; the distance between the eyes and the sample and position of the eyes relative to the sample; and the size of the sample.

 [0050] In practice, color cabinets are used with standard light sources for visual color determinations. Color meters and spectrophotometers are used for instrument color readings.

Unless otherwise indicated, the color values described in the Examples, and all reference herein to color values L, C, H, a and b (a* and b*, respectively), are readings using the Datacolor Spectraflash 500 Color spectrophotometer. The color parameters described herein refer to the L, C, H parameters that can be calculated from L, a and b readings according to the CIE 1976 system. The color values recited herein are approximate in the sense that color measurements may vary from </p><p id="p0060" num="0060">spectiOphotometer-to-spectiOphotometer, typically in the range of +/- 0.5 for L, C and H values. Therefore, the stated values for L, C and H are intended to include such variation inherent between spectrophotometers.
