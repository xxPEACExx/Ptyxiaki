It further relates to a packaged food concentrate comprising particulate food material. It further relates to a process to prepare a ready-to-eat end product. </p><p id="p0003" num="0003">Background of the invention </p><p id="p0004" num="0004"> Traditional formats of savoury food concentrates are dry or pasty tablets or cubes which are produced by compression or extrusion of an ingredient mixture. Such concentrates are known for example as a stock cube. In addition, concentrated products are known in granular form. Savoury food concentrates are usually diluted in an aqueous liquid to provide a ready to eat end product such as a soup or bouillon or are diluted in a dish to provide a flavouring to a dish or a meal. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">A relatively new format of savoury food concentrates is a savoury food concentrate with the appearance of a gel. Such a concentrate is described for example in WO2007/068484. The food concentrate in the form of a gel provides a texture to the food concentrate which is recognized by consumers as a natural or "home-made" product. Home-made products like bouillons, soups or sauces often tend to gelatinize or solidify after cooling, at least in some extent, for example as a consequence of the use of meat and bones during preparation, in this way providing a jelly appearance to the cooled product. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">An aspect which is further recognised as natural or "home-made" is a relatively high amount of particulate food material in the ready-to eat end product, such as for example chunks of vegetable or meat. Some consumers prefer that these particulate food materials are relatively large. When present in the food concentrate, this particulate food material preferably looks wet. Dry particles may provide an unnatural appearance to the food product. A concentrate with the appearance of a gel provides the advantage that it allows incorporation of moist ingredients, contributing to a natural and "home-made" appearance. A problem observed with a process to prepare a food concentrate with the appearance of a gel as described in the art, is that the addition of a relatively high amount of particulate food material to the ingredient mixture results in complications during production. For example, a proper gel appearance may not be obtained, or the ingredient mixture can not be mixed without problems. For example, during mixing, a paste-like texture may result which can have a very high viscosity, complicating mixing, shearing, pumping, and filling procedures. Further, 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 the desired amount of particulate food material may not fit in the food concentrate. An additional problem observed with a process as described in the art is that the integrity of the particulate food material may become damaged or is completely lost during mixing of the ingredients, especially if it comprises relatively large food particles. Complications are observed during the filling procedure where filling nozzles might get obstructed by particulate food material. A further problem is that the dilution speed of a concentrate comprising particulate material can be relatively low. A further problem is that after dilution of the food concentrate comprising particulate food material, the particulate material tends to collect at the bottom of the pan, cup or plate, whereas it is often preferred that it is more visible for the consumer. A further problem observed for conventional food concentrates in the form of a gel is that they may show syneresis, which is not always desired from a consumer perspective. Syneresis is a problem which may be increased in gels with relatively high salt levels. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Summary of the invention </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Therefore, it is an aim of the present invention, to provide a process to produce a food concentrate, which food concentrate allows to provide a ready-to-eat end product upon dilution in an aqueous liquid, and which, at least partly, overcomes above mentioned problems. The process preferably allows the production of a food concentrate with the appearance of a gel comprising a relatively high amount of particulate food material, preferably with relatively big dimensions, while maintaining a jelly appearance of the concentrate and the integrity of the particulate food material. It is a further aim to produce a food concentrate with the appearance of a gel, which allows to provide a ready-to-eat end product upon dilution of the concentrate, wherein the ready to eat end product comprises a relatively high amount of particulate food material, preferably comprises relatively large food particles. Therefore, the concentrate comprises a relatively high amount of particulate food material, and preferably comprises relatively large food particles. The particulate food material is preferably visible in the pan, cup or plate after preparation of the ready-to-eat food product, preferably at the surface of the ready-to-eat end product, such as a bouillon, a soup, or a sauce. Preferably, the particulate food material is present in the food concentrate in a moist state. The food concentrate preferably dissolves relatively fast, e.g. compared to a conventional food concentrate in the form of a gel, which may comprise some particulate food material. The food concentrate preferably shows a reduced amount of syneresis, e.g. when compared to a conventional food concentrate in the form of a gel which may comprise some particulate food material.

 Surprisingly, the above mentioned problem was solved by a process to prepare a packaged food concentrate with the appearance of a gel, comprising the steps of: </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> a) Providing a solution comprising: </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> â€¢ Water, </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> â€¢ An effective amount of gelling system, </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> b) Combining the solution resulting from step a) with at least one item comprising compressed food material, </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> c) Packaging the combination resulting from step b), </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> d) Solidifying the combination resulting from step c), </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">to result in a packaged food concentrate with the appearance of a gel. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The invention further relates to a packaged food concentrate comprising: </p><p id="p0017" num="0017"> â€¢ a gel matrix, </p><p id="p0018" num="0018"> â€¢ at least one aggregate comprising particulate food material. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The invention further relates to a process to prepare a ready-to-eat end product comprising the step of dissolving a food concentrate according to the invention in an aqueous liquid, to result in a ready-to-eat end product.

 Particulate: in the form of particles. Step a </p><p id="p0024" num="0024"> In a first step a) of the process of the invention, a solution is provided comprising water, and 5 effective amount of gelling system. This solution provides the basis of the gel matrix of the food concentrate. The gelling system might be any gelling system, which is suitable to provide a gel matrix in the food concentrate of the present invention and can be used in the field of food products. "Effective amount" should be interpreted here as the amount suitable to form a solid (not fluid) gel matrix (after solidifying). Although the amount of gelling system might</p><p id="p0025" num="0025">10 depend on factors such as the ingredients forming the gelling system and the salt content, it is in the art of the skilled person to determine relatively easily the appropriate amount of gelling system to provide a food concentrate with the appearance of a gel. For example, when gelatine is used as a gelling system, a relatively high amount of gelling system is preferred to provide a gel with the desired features. When polysaccharide hydrocolloids are used as a</p><p id="p0026" num="0026">15 gelling system, relatively low amounts of gelling system may be sufficient. </p><p id="p0027" num="0027"> In step a) of the process of the invention preferably a solution is provided comprising at least part, more preferably all of the water and the gelling system. In a preferred situation, in addition to water and gelling system, salt is also added in step a). </p><p id="p0028" num="0028">20 As known to the person skilled in the art, providing a solution comprising an effective amount of gelling agent in water may comprise a heating step. During such a heating step, the gelling system in the solution of step a) is dissolved and activated. Heating of the mixture comprising water and the gelling system is preferably at least up to the temperature where the gelling system is totally dissolved in the water, and activated. The presence of a heating step and the</p><p id="p0029" num="0029">25 temperature depends on the individual ingredients forming the gelling system, as known to a person skilled in the art. Therefore, the step a) of providing a solution comprising water and an effective amount of gelling system preferably comprises heating, preferably heating at a temperature above the activation temperature of the gelling system. Preferably the heating step is carried out at a temperature of from 50Â°C to 100 Â°C, more preferably of from 55 Â°C to</p><p id="p0030" num="0030">30 95Â°C, most preferably of from 60Â°C to 90Â°C. It might be preferred that step a) comprises heating to a temperature of between 75Â°C and 100 Â°C, preferably 80Â°C and 95 Â°C, for example when the gelling system comprises xanthan gum and a galactomannan, preferably xanthan gum and locust bean gum. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 Optionally, any other remaining ingredients may be added to the solution before or after dissolution of the gelling system, preferably before packaging. For example, the solution further may comprise salt, which is preferably added before optional heating. Step b </p><p id="p0031" num="0031"> In step b), the solution resulting from step a) is combined with at least one item comprising compressed food material. The item comprising compressed food material preferably becomes surrounded with the solution resulting form step a). In this way, the item is inside of the food concentrate. Combining can be carried out in several ways. For example, part of the solution comprising water and gelling system is poured in the packaging, the at least one item comprising compressed food material is added and then the remainder of the solution comprising water and gelling system is added. Alternatively, the solution comprising water and gelling system can be added to the packaging, followed or preceded by addition of the at least one item comprising compressed food material. In these preferred ways, combining is carried out in the packaging. It is noted in this respect that a compression step on food material can be carried out inside of the packaging, to result in an item comprising </p><p id="p0032" num="0032">compressed food material, preferably before the solution comprising the gelling system is added. In a third way, it may be preferred that a premix is prepared of the solution comprising the gelling system and the at least one item comprising, compressed food material, which premix is then filled into a packaging. How the solution comprising water and the gelling system is combined with the at least one item comprising compressed food material may for example depend on the type and size of the item comprising compressed food material, the number of items to be added, the type and size of packaging, the viscosity of the solution comprising water and the gelling system at the moment of filling and the temperature of the solution comprising water and the gelling system or of the item comprising compressed food material. For example, when some relatively small items comprising compressed food material are used, it may be preferred to use a premix. Whereas when one item comprising compressed food material is used, it may be preferred to add the solution comprising water and gelling system and the item in two or three steps, to minimize possible floating of the at least one item in the solution comprising water and the gelling system, possibly combined with a relatively low temperature of the solution comprising water and the gelling system and/or of the at least one item comprising compressed food material. It is in the art of a skilled person to combine the solution comprising water and the gelling system with the at least one item comprising compressed food material.

This proved especially advantageous, when the water activity of the item comprising compressed food material is higher than 0.65. Addition of the item comprising compressed food material in a frozen state reduces the risk of floating of the item during the step of combining the item comprising compressed food material and the solution comprising water and gelling system.

By solidifying, the gelling system in the solution forms a gel matrix.

During maturation, an equilibrium in the content of water and other ingredients such as salt is reached between the gel matrix and the at least one item comprising compressed food material. During maturation, the item comprising compressed food material changes. The food material may partly hydrate and may gain a wet appearance. The food material originating from the item comprising compressed food material may be described now as an aggregate of particulate food material, as the food material is still gathered together and forms a quantity of food material which is not separated by the gel matrix. </p><p id="p0041" num="0041">Gel matrix </p><p id="p0042" num="0042"> The present invention relates to a process to prepare a packaged food concentrate.

The at least one aggregate comprising particulate food material can be construed as a solid, non-gel phase. The gel matrix is preferably a continuous structure.

The person skilled in the art is able to recognize a gel, and to discriminate its texture from that of a liquid or of a paste. The gel matrix is preferably in the form of a gel. A gel should be understood as a texture that is substantially shape stable at 20 degrees C and is elastic, after removal from the packaging. Due to gravity, a relatively weak gel might (slightly) deform, after removal from its packaging. The gel structure of the matrix preferably allows removal from a plastic tub without significant damage, possibly with the help of a spoon. A gel texture shows elastic deformation. This type of deformation is to a large extent reversible. For example, after reducing deforming pressure, e.g. from gravity or gentle pressure by a finger, the shape will reform to a large extent to its original form. In addition, at 20Â° C, a gel in the context of the present invention does not flow, like a liquid, but is indeed solid. Further, at ambient temperatures (e.g. at 20Â° C), after cutting of the gel matrix in some pieces, the pieces of gel matrix usually cannot be substantially adhered and united by simple re-assembling of the gel matrix pieces, to form the original volume of the gel matrix. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044"> In contrast to a gel, a paste does not show elastic deformation but shows a plastic </p><p id="p0045" num="0045">deformation behaviour, at least, the plastic deformation is (much) higher than the elastic deformation. Thus, after deformation by pressure, a paste will hardly return towards its original shape, if at all. Also liquid products neither show elastic deformation, nor are they shape stable after removal from the package. It is therefore in the normal skill of the artisan, to assess whether a product is a gel or not. </p><p id="p0046" num="0046">More preferably, the gel matrix has a rheology wherein the ratio of the elastic modulus G' : the viscous modulus G" is higher then 1 , preferably higher than 3, more preferably higher than 5.

Food concentrate and Dilution 
<!-- EPO <DP n="19"/>-->
 The present invention relates to a food concentrate. The food concentrate is preferably obtainable by the process of the present invention. A concentrate is a food product that is usually diluted before consumption. In this way, it should be discriminated from a ready-to-eat product, which is normally consumed as such, without dilution. </p><p id="p0108" num="0108">The food concentrate preferably has a weight of from 10g to 300 g. The food concentrate preferably has the shape of a sphere, a prism, a cone or a cylinder, more preferably of an oval cylinder or truncated cone. Especially the latter two shapes were most advantageous in preparation and removal of the concentrate from the packaging. </p><p id="p0109" num="0109">To enable dilution of the concentrate of the present invention, the concentrate should be dissolvable in water, preferably at for example 90Â°C. Dissolvability should be preferably relatively fast. Preferably a concentrate according to the present invention with a size of 37g dissolves in 500 ml water of 90Â°C, using stirring, e.g. by using wire whisk, in a time period of less than 4 minutes, more preferably less than 3 minutes, even more preferably less than 2 minutes. This is the way a consumer would normally use the product of the invention. It was observed in conventional concentrates that particulate food material may sometimes have a negative effect on dilution speed of food concentrate in the form of a gel. Counter-intuitively, it was observed that a food concentrate wherein the particulate food material was added as compressed material according to the invention, the dilution of the concentrate improved considerably compared to the dilution of gel concentrates without particulate material or gel concentrates wherein the particulate material was added in non-compressed form, e.g. as freeze dried (non-compressed) or frozen particles. This effect was observed even when high amounts of particulate food material were used (based on the weight of hydrated particulate food material). </p><p id="p0110" num="0110">The invention further relates to a process to produce a ready-to-eat end product, comprising the step of dissolving a food concentrate according to the invention in an aqueous liquid, to result in a ready-to-eat end product. The food concentrate of the present invention is preferably a concentrate for preparing a bouillon, a soup or a sauce. The food concentrate might also be a concentrate for use as a seasoning. For the latter purpose, the concentrate of the invention may be added to a prepared dish, preferably a liquid dish, wherein it melts and becomes diluted and the particulate food material preferably becomes hydrated. The concentrate might also for example be added to the cooking water of noodles, wherein it 
<!-- EPO <DP n="20"/>-->
 dissolves, in this way providing its seasoning effect to the noodles. The ready to eat end product is therefore preferably a bouillon, a soup, a sauce or a seasoned dish. </p><p id="p0111" num="0111">As the concentrate of the present invention is a concentrated product, it should preferably allow dilution of between 2 to 40 times, preferably of between 3 and 20 times, more preferably of between 4 and 10 times, based on the weight of the product, to result in a ready-to-eat end product. </p><p id="p0112" num="0112">After dilution of the concentrated food product in an aqueous liquid, the compressed food material becomes hydrated, and the dilution results in a ready to eat end product. Preferably the at least one item comprising, compressed food material is added during preparation of the food concentrate in an amount to provide an amount of hydrated food material in the ready to eat end product of from 5 to 50 g/500ml, preferably of from 10g to 40 g/500ml. Consequently, preferably the food concentrate comprises at least one aggregate comprising particulate food material in an amount to provide an amount of hydrated food material in the ready to eat end product of from 5 to 50 g/500ml, preferably of from 10 g to 40 g/500ml. The amount of particulate food material in the ready to eat end product is preferably of from 1 to 30 wt%, more preferably of from 1 to 15 wt%, more preferably of from 5 to 12 wt%. These amounts are preferably combined with a salt content in the ready to eat end product which is preferably of between 0.5 and 1.5 wt%, more preferably of from 0.7 to 1.2 wt%. As indicated above, these amounts are preferably reached after dilution of between 2 to 40 times, preferably of between 3 and 20 times, more preferably of between 4 and 10 times, based on the weight of the product. Preferably the invention relates to a packaged food concentrate which further comprising salt, wherein the food concentrate after dilution in an aqueous liquid can result in a ready-to-eat end product comprising salt in an amount of from 0.5 wt% to 1.5 wt%, and particulate food material in an amount of from 1 wt% to 30 wt% of, based on the weight of the ready to eat end product. </p><p id="p0113" num="0113">As indicated above, the weight of the at least one item comprising compressed food material as used in the process of the present invention is from 2 wt% to 95 wt%, preferably of from 10 wt% to 70 wt%, more preferably of from 15 wt% to 60 wt%, based on the weight of the total food concentrate. This is calculated as after a period of maturation, as the weight of the compressed food material may change after contact with the gel matrix. After this maturation 
<!-- EPO <DP n="21"/>-->
 time, the item comprising compressed food material usually beomes in the form of an aggregate comprising food material. Consequently, the weight of the aggregate comprising particulate food material is preferably of from 2 wt% to 95 wt%, preferably of from 10 wt% to 70 wt%, more preferably of from 15 wt% to 60 wt%, based on the weight of the total food concentrate. </p><p id="p0114" num="0114">The size of the particulate food material as present in the ready-to-eat end product is preferably of between 0.5 mm to 50 mm, more preferably of from 1 mm to 40 mm, even more preferably of from 3 mm to 30 mm, most preferably of from 5 mm to 25 mm. This size is measured of the longest diameter of the particle. For example, mushrooms or slices thereof or broccoli florets can be about 2 cm, beans can be up to 5 cm. </p><p id="p0115" num="0115">Advantages </p><p id="p0116" num="0116"> The process of the present invention allows incorporation of food material in an amount which is not reached in a conventional production process of food concentrates in the form of a gel. In addition, the appearance of a gel is maintained and the food concentrate does not become a paste. During the process, the integrity of relatively large particles of food material is not destroyed. The process is efficient, filling of the packaging is not hindered by obstruction of the filling nozzles. The complications observed when a conventional preparation process is used are overcome. </p><p id="p0117" num="0117"> The food concentrate of the present invention showed improved dissolution properties and reduced syneresis of liquid from the gel matrix of the food concentrate. It showed improved visibility of the particulate food material at the surface of the ready to eat product resulting after dilution.

 Preparation gel solution </p><p id="p0210" num="0210"> The gel phase was prepared on labscale on an Unimix LM6 with the following process (batch size: 5kg): </p><p id="p0211" num="0211">Water was added into the mixing vessel and heated up to 75Â°C. Both stirring (150 rpm) and homogenizing (5000 rpm) units were used over the whole process. Pre-mixed dry ingredients including gelling agents but not including the starch were added into the mixture at 75Â°C and the mixture was further heated during homogenization to allow dilution of the dry ingredients into water. After a pasteurization of 4 min at 85Â°C, the mixture was cooled down to 59Â°C. At that temperature the starch was added into the vessel (3 min addition time) and the mixture was further homogenized during 3 min at 8000 rpm. During addition of the starch, a decrease in temperature of the mixture was observed down to 57Â°C. </p><p id="p0212" num="0212">Preparation of items comprising compressed food material </p><p id="p0213" num="0213">The dry vegetables were rehydrated as described in example 2 to a moisture content as indicated in Table 7. </p><p id="p0214" num="0214"> Vegetables were weighed and pressed into tablets, using an oval mould and a pressure of 4 bars to obtain stable oval tablets.
