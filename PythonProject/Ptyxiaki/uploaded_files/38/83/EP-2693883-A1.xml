For example, there is an urgent need for therapies that are capable of, e.g., modulating protein-protein interactions, e.g., by interacting, simultaneously with multiple domains on a single protein, or a domain on one protein along with a domain on another protein. There is also an urgent need for such therapies that modulate fusion proteins, such as those that occur in cancer. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">[0003] For example, signaling pathways are used by cells to generate biological responses to external or internal stimuli. A few thousand gene products control both ontogeny/development of higher organisms and sophisticated behavior by their many different cell types. These gene products can work in different combinations to achieve their goals and often do so through protein-protein interactions. Such proteins possess modular protein domains that recognize, bind, and/or modify certain motifs. Protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid recognition often function through protein interactions domains, for example, such as the SH2, SH3, and PDZ domains. These protein-interaction domains may represent a meaningful area for developing targeted therapies. Other macromolecular interactions that may serve as potential targets for effective therapies include protein-nucleic acid interactions, protein- carbohydrate interactions, and protein-lipid interactions. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> [0004] Current drug design and drug therapy approaches do not address this urgent need to find drugs that interfere with intracellular protein-protein interactions or protein signaling. Although antibodies and other biological therapeutic agents may have sufficient specificity to distinguish among closely related protein surfaces, factors such as their high

 molecular weight prevent oral administration and uptake of the antibodies. Conversely, orally active pharmaceuticals are generally too small to disrupt protein-protein surface interactions, which can be much larger than the orally active pharmaceuticals. Further, previous attempts to link, e.g., two pharmacophores that each interact with e.g. different protein domains have focused on large covalently linked compounds assembled in organic solvents. These assemblies typically have a molecular weight too large for oral administration or effective cellular and tissue permeation. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> SUMMARY </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">[0005] Described herein are monomers capable of forming a biologically useful multimer when in contact with one, two, three or more other monomers in an aqueous media.

In one aspect, such monomers may be capable of binding to another monomer in an aqueous media (e.g. in vivo) to form a multimer, (e.g. a dimer). Contemplated monomers may include a ligand moiety (e.g. a ligand or pharmacophore moiety), a linker element, and a connector element that joins the ligand moiety and the linker element. In an aqueous media, such contemplated monomers may join together via each linker element and may thus be capable of modulating one or more biomolecules substantially simultaneously, e.g., modulate two or more binding domains on a protein or on different proteins. For example, contemplated monomers may be separate or separatable in a solid or in an aqueous media under one set of conditions, and when placed in an aqueous media having one or more biomolecules, with another (e.g., under a different set of conditions), can 1) form a multimer through the linker on each monomer; and either: 2a) bind to the biomolecule in two or more locations (e.g. protein domains) through each ligand moiety of the respective monomer or 2b) bind to two or more biomolecules through each ligand moiety of the respective monomer. In an exemplary 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
 embodiment, disclosed monomers may interact with another appropriate monomer (i.e. a monomeric pair) in an aqueous media (e.g., in vivo) to form a multimer (e.g. a dimer) that can bind to two separate target biomolecule domains (e.g. protein domains). </p><p id="p0078" num="0078">[0022] The ligand moiety of a contemplated monomer, in some cases, may be a pharmacophore or a ligand moiety that is e.g., capable of binding to a biomolecule, such as for example, a protein, e.g. a specific protein domain, a component of a biological cell such as ribosome (composed of proteins and nucleic acids), or an enzyme active site (e.g. a protease, such as tryptase). In some embodiments, the linker element comprises a functional group capable of forming a chemical bond with another linker element. In some embodiments, the linker moiety may also serve as a signaling entity or "reporter," and in some instances the assembly of two or more linkers can produce a fluorescent entity or fluorophore with properties distinct from the individual linker moiety. In another aspect, a plurality of monomers, each comprising a linker element, may react to form a multimer connected by the linker elements. In some embodiments, the multimer may be formedm vivo. In some instances, the multimer may have enhanced properties relative to the monomers that form the multimer. For example, in certain embodiments, the multimer may bind to a target with greater affinity than any of the monomers that form the multimer. Also described are methods of making the compositions and methods of administering the compositions. </p><p id="p0079" num="0079"> [0023] In some embodiments, a plurality of monomers may assemble to form a multimer. The multimer may be used for a variety of purposes. For example, in some instances, the multimer may be used to perturb a biological system. As described in more detail below, in some embodiments, the multimer may bind to a target biomolecule, such as a protein, nucleic acid, or polysaccharide. In certain embodiments, the multimer may be used as a pharmaceutical. </p><p id="p0080" num="0080">[0024] Advantageously, in some embodiments, the multimer may form in vivo upon administration of suitable monomers to a subject. Also advantageously, the multimer may be capable of interacting with a relatively large target site as compared to the individual monomers that form the multimer. For example, a target may comprise, in some embodiments, two protein domains separated by a distance such that a multimer, but not a monomer, may be capable of binding to both domains essentially simultaneously. In some embodiments, contemplated multimers may bind to a target with greater affinity as compared to a monomer binding affinity alone. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="13"/>-->
 [0025] In some embodiments, a contemplated multimer may advantageously exhibit enhanced properties relative to the monomers that form the multimer. As discussed above, a multimer may have improved binding properties as compared to the monomers alone. In some embodiments, a multimer may have improved signaling properties. For example, in some cases, the fluorescent properties of a multimer may be different as compared to a monomer. As discussed in more detail below, in some embodiments the fluorescent brightness of a multimer at a particular wavelength may be greater than the fluorescent brightness at the same wavelength of the monomers that form the multimer. Advantageously, in some embodiments, a difference in signaling properties between the multimer and the monomers that form the multimer may be used to detect formation of the multimer. In some embodiments, detection of the formation of the multimer may be used to screen monomers, as discussed in more detail below. Also as discussed in more detail below, in some embodiments, the multimers may be used for imaging or as diagnostic agents. </p><p id="p0081" num="0081"> [0026] It should be understood that a multimer, as used herein, may be a homomultimer (i.e., a multimer formed from two or more essentially identical monomers) or may be a heteromultimer (i.e., a multimer formed from two or more substantially different monomers). In some embodiments, a contemplated multimer may comprise 2 to about 10 monomers, for example, a multimer may be a dimer, a trimer, a tetramer, or a pentamer. </p><p id="p0082" num="0082">[0027] In some embodiments, a monomer may comprise a ligand moiety, a linker element, and a connector element that associates the ligand moiety with the linker element. In some embodiments, the linker element of a first monomer may combine with the linker element of a second monomer. In some cases, the linker element may comprise a functional group that can react with a functional group of another linker element to form a bond linking the monomers. In some embodiments, the linker element of a first monomer may be substantially the same as the linker element of a second monomer. In some embodiments, the linker element of a first monomer may be substantially different than the linker element of a second monomer. </p><p id="p0083" num="0083">[0028] In some cases, the ligand moiety may be a pharmacophore. In some </p><p id="p0084" num="0084">embodiments, the ligand moiety (e.g., a pharmacophore) may bind to a target molecule with a dissociation constant of less than 1 mM, in some embodiments less than 500 microM, in some embodiments less than 300 microM, in some embodiments less than 100 microM, in some embodiments less than 10 microM, in some embodiments less than 1 microM, in some embodiments less than 100 nM, in some embodiments less than 10 nM, and in some embodiments less than 1 nM.

 [0029] In some embodiments, the IC<sub>50</sub> of the first monomer against a first target biomolecule and the IC<sub>50</sub> of the second monomer against a second target biomolecule (or second binding site on the first biomolecule) may be greater than the apparent IC<sub>50</sub> of a combination of the monomers against the first target biomolecule and the second target biomolecule (or second binding site on the first biomolecule). That is, the apparent IC<sub>50</sub> of a combination of the monomers against the first target biomolecule and the second target biomolecule may advantageously be lower than the IC<sub>50</sub> of the first monomer against a first target biomolecule and the IC<sub>50</sub> of the second monomer against a second target biomolecule. The combination of monomers may be any suitable ratio. For example, the ratio of the first monomer to the second monomer may be between 10: 1 to 1 : 10, in some embodiments between 5: 1 and 1:5, and in some embodiments between 2: 1 and 1:2. In some cases, the ratio of the first monomer to the second monomer may be essentially 1: 1. In some instances, the ratio of the smaller of the IC<sub>50</sub> of the first monomer and the second monomer to the apparent IC<sub>50</sub> of the multimer may be at least 3.0. In other instances, the ratio of the smaller IC<sub>50</sub> of the first monomer or the second monomer to the apparent IC<sub>50</sub> of the multimer may be at least 10.0. In some embodiments, the ratio of the smaller IC<sub>50</sub> of the first monomer or the second monomer to the apparent IC<sub>50</sub> of the multimer may be at least 30.0. </p><p id="p0085" num="0085"> [0030] For example, for disclosed monomers forming a heteromultimer, the apparent</p><p id="p0086" num="0086">IC<sub>50</sub> resulting from an essentially equimolar combination of monomers against the first target biomolecule and the second target biomolecule is at least about 3 to 10 fold lower, at least about 10 to 30 fold lower, at least about 30 fold lower, or at least about 40 to 50 fold lower than the lowest of the IC<sub>50</sub> of the second monomer against the second target biomolecule or the IC<sub>50</sub> of the first monomer against the first target biomolecule. </p><p id="p0087" num="0087"> [0031] It will be appreciated that for monomers forming homodimers (or homo- oligomeric or homomultimeric, as described below), in aqueous solution, there may an equilibrium between the monomeric and dimeric (or oligomeric) states with higher </p><p id="p0088" num="0088">concentrations favoring greater extent of dimer formation. As the binding of monomers to the target biomolecule increases their proximity and effectively increases their local concentration on the target, the rate and extent of dimerization (oligomerization) is promoted when geometries are favorable. As a result, the occupancy of the target by favorable monomers may be nearly completely in the homodimeric (or oligomeric) state. In this manner the target for example, may serve as a template for the dimerization of the monomers, significantly enhancing the extent and rate of dimerization.

 [0032] Affinities of heterodimerizing monomers for the target biomolecule(s) can often be assessed through the testing of the respective monomers in appropriate assays for the target activity or biology because their self-association to form homo-dimers may not be promoted by binding to the target(s). In contrast, the testing of homodimerizing monomers may not, in some embodiments, afford an affinity solely for the monomeric or dimeric state, but rather the observed effect (e.g. IC<sub>50</sub>) is a result of the monomer-dimer dynamics and equilibrium, with the apparent binding affinity (or IC<sub>50</sub>) being e.g., a weighted measure of the monomer and dimeric inhibitory effects upon the target. In some embodiments, a dimeric species may not form in detectable concentrations in solution, yet a target biomolecule may be bound primarily by the dimeric species, indicating that a dimeric species does in fact form. Thus, the ability or lack of ability to detect a dimeric species in solution should not be construed as an indication of whether dimeric species is being formed. </p><p id="p0089" num="0089"> [0033] In some cases, the pH of the aqueous fluid in which the multimer forms may be between pH 1 and and 9, in some embodiments between pH 1 and 3, in some embodiments between pH 3 and 5, in some embodiments between pH 5 and 7, and in some embodiments between pH 7 and 9. In some embodiments, the multimer may be stable in an aqueous solution having a pH between pH 1 and 9, in some embodiments between pH 1 and 3, in some embodiments between pH 3 and 5, in some embodiments between pH 5 and 7, and in some embodiments between pH 7 and 9. In some embodiments, the aqueous solution may have a physiologically acceptable pH. </p><p id="p0090" num="0090"> [0034] In some embodiments, the ligand moiety may be capable of binding to a target and at least partially disrupting a biomolecule-biomolecule interaction (e.g., a protein-protein interaction). In some embodiments, the ligand moiety may be capable of binding to a target and at least partially disrupting a protein-nucleic acid interaction. In some cases, the ligand moiety may be capable of binding to a target and at least partially disrupting a protein-lipid interaction. In some cases, the ligand moiety may be capable of binding to a target and at least partially disrupting a protein-polysaccharide interaction. In some embodiments, the ligand moiety may be capable of at least partially stabilizing a biomolecule-biomolecule interaction. In certain embodiments, the ligand moiety may be capable of at least partially inhibiting a conformational change in a biomolecule target. </p><p id="p0091" num="0091"> [0035] In some instances, the linker element may be capable of generating a signal.

In some embodiments, a linker element in a multimer may have a peak fluorescence that is red-shifted relative to the peak fluorescence of the linker element in a monomer.

In certain embodiments, the multimer may have a dissociation constant of less than 10 mM, in some embodiments less than 1 mM, in some embodiments less than 500 μΜ, in some embodiments less than 100 μΜ, in some embodiments less than 50 μΜ, in some embodiments less than 1 μΜ, in some embodiments less than 100 nM, and in some embodiments less than 1 nM. </p><p id="p0280" num="0280"> [0063] While the affinity of the multimer for its target biomolecule(s) often cannot be measured directly due to the dynamic reversible equilibrium with its monomers in an aqueous or biological milieu, it may be possible to extract an apparent multimer-target dissociation constant from a series of experimental determinations. Exploring the effects of a matrix of monomer concentrations, monomer ratios, along with changes in concentration(s) in the target biomolecule(s), coupled with determinations of multimer-monomer dissociation constants, and in some cases additional binding competition, kinetic and biophysical methods, one can extract an estimate of the affinity of the multimeric assembly for its target(s). Through such approaches, one can demonstrate that in some embodiments, the affinity of the multimer for the target biomolecule(s) are less than 1 μΜ, in some embodiments less than 1 nM, in some embodiments less than 1 pM, in some embodiments less than 1 fM, and in some embodiments less than 1 aM, and in some embodiments less than 1 zM.

Currently, there are over 75 such motifs reported in the literature (Hunter, et al., Cell 100: 113-127 (2000); Pawson et al., Genes &amp; Development 14: 1027-1047 (2000)). For example, SH2 domains are miniature receptors for protein regions containing a phosphorylated tyrosine. SH2 domains may be found in proteins that act as, or play a role in, for example, adaptors, scaffolds, kinases, phosphatases, ras signalling, transcription, ubiquitination, cytoskeletal regulation, signal regulation, and phospholipid second messenger signaling. As another non-limiting example, SH3 domains bind peptide loops with the motif RXXK or PXXP. Many proteins have both SH2 and SH3 domains, which act as "receptors" to bind one or more protein partners. Coferons may be designed to inhibit binding of a phosphotyrosine protein to its cognate SH2 domain. Alternatively, monomers and multimers may be designed so one ligand binds one motif (i.e. SH2), and a second ligand moiety binds a second motif (i.e. SH3), either on the same or different proteins. </p><p id="p0321" num="0321"> [0087] Many large proteins or macromolecular complexes (e.g., ribosomes) have multiple binding sites with known drug inhibitors. In some embodiments, linker elements may be used to bring together two pharmacophores on the same target to: (i) bind the target with higher affinity; (ii) exhibit a stronger inhibition than either pharmacophore alone; (iii) exhibit greater activation than either pharmacophore alone; or (iv) create a binding entity covering a larger surface area of the target, making it harder for the organism/cell/virus to develop resistance to the drug via point mutations. </p><p id="p0322" num="0322"> [0088] In some embodiments, a multimer may target a tryptase. For example, a multimer may be used to treat conditions activated by a trypase, such as mast cell mediated inflammatory conditions (e.g. asthma). Asthma is frequently characterized by progressive 
<!-- EPO <DP n="53"/>-->
 development of hyper-responsiveness of the trachea and bronchi to both immuno specific allergens and generalized chemical or physical stimuli, which lead to the onset of chronic inflammation. Leukocytes containing IgE receptors, notably mast cells and basophils, are present in the epithelium and underlying smooth muscle tissues of bronchi. These leukocytes initially become activated by the binding of specific inhaled antigens to the IgE receptors and then release a number of chemical mediators. For example, degranulation of mast cells leads to the release of proteoglycans, peroxidase, arylsulfatase B, chymase, and tryptase, which results in bronchiole constriction. </p><p id="p0323" num="0323"> [0089] Human mast cell β-tryptase-II is a tetrameric serine protease that is concentrated in mast cell secretory granules. The enzyme is involved in IgE-induced mast cell degranulation in an allergic response and is potentially a target for the treatment of allergic asthma, rhinitis, conjunctivitis and dermatitis. Tryptase has also been implicated in the progression of renal, pulmonary, hepatic, testicular fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and various other mast cell-related diseases. In some embodiments, multimers may be used to treat such diseases. </p><p id="p0324" num="0324"> [0090] Tryptase is stored in the mast cell secretory granules and is the major protease of human mast cells. Tryptase has been implicated in a variety of biological processes, including degradation of vasodilatory and bronchodilatory neuropeptides and modulation of bronchial responsiveness to histamine. As a result, tryptase inhibitors may be useful as antiinflammatory agents for treatment of inflammatory disease and may also be useful in treating or preventing allergic rhinitis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, ocular or vernal or ulcerative conjunctivitis, dermatological conditions (e.g., psoriasis, eczema, or atopic dermatitis), arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, hematoid arthritis, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or gouty arthritis), rheumatoid spondylitis, interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diseases of joint cartilage destruction. </p><p id="p0325" num="0325"> [0091] In addition, tryptase has been shown to be a potent mitogen for fibroblasts, suggesting its involvement in the pulmonary fibrosis in asthma and interstitial lung diseases. Therefore, in some embodiments, tryptase inhibitors may be useful in treating or preventing fibrotic conditions, for example, fibrosis, sceleroderma, pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, myocardial fibrosis, neurofibromas, hepatic fibrosis, renal fibrosis, testicular, and hypertrophic scars. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="54"/>-->
 [0092] Additionally, tryptase inhibitors may be useful in treating or preventing myocardial infarction, stroke, angina and other consequences of atherosclerotic plaque rupture. </p><p id="p0326" num="0326">[0093] Tryptase has also been discovered to activate prostromelysin that in turn activates collagenase, thereby initiating the destruction of cartilage and periodontal connective tissue, respectively. In some embodiments, tryptase inhibitors may be useful in the treatment or prevention of arthritis, periodontal disease, diabetic retinopathy, a condition relating to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, anaphylatis ulcerative colitis, and tumour growth. Also, tryptase inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of anaphylaxis, multiple sclerosis, peptic ulcers, and syncytial viral infections. </p><p id="p0327" num="0327">[0094] A variety of antibiotics elicit their antibacterial activity by binding to the bacterial ribosome and inhibiting protein synthesis. Many of these antibiotics bind the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome (P site). In some embodiments, a multimer may bind to two or more sites on the ribosome. For example, a first pharmacophore of a multimer may bind to the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome (i.e., the P site) and a second multimer may bind to site adjacent to the P site. As a non-limiting, illustrative example, Linezolid, an </p><p id="p0328" num="0328">oxazolidinone antibiotic, is believed to bind adjacent to the binding site for Sparsomycin. The close juxtaposition of the linezolid binding site with the sparosmycin binding site presents a possible scenario for developing monomers based on linezolid and sparsomycin that can dimerize on binding to the ribosome, thereby creating a high affinity and high specificity inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis. </p><p id="p0329" num="0329"> [0095] Other non-limiting examples of target protein families are provided in Table 1 below.

 [0098] A pharmacophore is typically an arrangement of the substituents of a moiety that confers biochemical or pharmacological effects. In some embodiments, identification of a pharmacophore may be facilitated by knowing the structure of the ligand in association with a target biomolecule. In some cases, pharmacophores may be moieties derived from molecules previously known to bind to target biomolecules (e.g., proteins), fragments identified, for example, through NMR or crystallographic screening efforts, molecules that have been discovered to bind to target proteins after performing high- throughput screening of natural products libraries, previously synthesized commercial or non-commercial combinatorial compound libraries, or molecules that are discovered to bind to target proteins by screening of newly synthesized combinatorial libraries. Since most pre-existing combinatorial libraries are limited in the structural space and diversity that they encompass, newly synthesized combinatorial libraries may include molecules that are based on a variety of scaffolds. </p><p id="p0577" num="0577"> [0099] Additionally pharmacophores may be derived from traditional approaches such as fragment based drug design and structure based drug design. Those skilled in the art will recognize that any pharmacophore including pre-existing pharmacophores such as approved drugs are amenable to be designed as monomers through the incorporation of the appropriate linker elements and connector elements. For example, previously approved drugs that have poor efficacy due to a low affinity for a first macromolecular target may be utilized as a pharmacophore component of a first monomer which when combined with a pharmacophore of a second monomer that also binds the first macromolecular target or a second macromolecular target that interacts with the first macromolecular target results in enhanced binding and, in some cases, higher efficacy. Likewise, previously approved drugs that have low efficacy as a result of size, molecular weight or other physicochemical attributes that reduce the cellular uptake of the drug may be amenable to being converted into one or more monomers that bear the appropriate pharmacophoric elements, such that each monomer has physicochemical attributes that allow for increased cellular uptake. </p><p id="p0578" num="0578"> [0100] In some embodiments, a ligand moiety (e.g., a pharmacophore) may have a molecular weight between 50 Da and 2000 Da, in some embodiments between 50 Da and 1500 Da, in some embodiments, between 50 Da and 1000 Da, and in some embodiments, between 50 Da and 500 Da.

 [0118] In another aspect, enteral pharmaceutical formulations including a disclosed pharmaceutical composition comprising monomers, dimers, and/or multimers, an enteric material; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient thereof are provided. Enteric materials refer to polymers that are substantially insoluble in the acidic environment of the stomach, and that are predominantly soluble in intestinal fluids at specific pHs.

Exemplary enteric materials include cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP), polyvinyl acetate phthalate (PVAP), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), cellulose acetate trimellitate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose succinate, cellulose acetate succinate, cellulose acetate hexahydrophthalate, cellulose propionate phthalate, cellulose acetate maleat, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate propionate, copolymer of methylmethacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate, copolymer of methyl acrylate, methylmethacrylate and methacrylic acid, copolymer of methylvinyl ether and maleic anhydride (Gantrez ES series), ethyl methyacrylate-methylmethacrylate-chlorotrimethylammonium ethyl acrylate copolymer, natural resins such as zein, shellac and copal collophorium, and several commercially available enteric dispersion systems (e. g. , Eudragit L30D55, Eudragit FS30D, Eudragit LlOO, Eudragit S100, Kollicoat EMM30D, Estacryl 30D, Coateric, and Aquateric). The solubility of each of the above materials is either known or is readily determinable in vitro.

 art. Such kits could advantageously be packaged and sold in single or multiple kit units. An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are sealed in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening. </p><p id="p0605" num="0605">[0120] It may be desirable to provide a memory aid on the kit, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card, e.g., as follows "First Week, Monday, Tuesday, . . . etc. . . . Second Week, Monday, Tuesday, . . . " etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A "daily dose" can be a single tablet or capsule or several pills or capsules to be taken on a given day. Also, a daily dose of a first compound can consist of one tablet or capsule while a daily dose of the second compound can consist of several tablets or capsules and vice versa. The memory aid should reflect this. </p><p id="p0606" num="0606"> [0121] Also contemplated herein are methods and compositions that include additional active agents, or administering additional active agents. </p><p id="p0607" num="0607">[0122] Also contemplated herein are methods and compositions that include additional active agents, or administering additional active agents. </p><p id="p0608" num="0608"> [0123] Certain terms employed in the specification, examples, and appended claims are collected here.
