 Object of the present invention was to find a polymer which allows dispersing a water- insoluble pesticide in aqueous compositions, especially in compositions comprising high concentrations of salts. The object was solved by an agrochemical composition containing a pesticide and a copolymer, which contains in polymerized form a) at least 20 wt% vinylimidazol and/or a quaternized vinylimidazol, b) an acidic comonomer, and c) a hydrophobic comonomer, which comprises C1-22 alkyl (meth)acrylate, mono C1-22 alkyl terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (meth)acrylate, vinyl ester of aliphatic C1-32 carboxylic acids, or vinyl C1-4 alkyl ether. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The copolymer contains vinylimidazol and/or a quaternized vinylimidazol in polymerized form (also called comonomer a)). Preferably, comonomer a) is vinylimidazol ("VI"). In a further preferred embodiment, comonomer a) contains vinylimidazol and a quater- nized vinylimidazol. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">The imidazolyl moieties of vinylimidazol may be quaternized. The conversion of co- monomers b) to quaternary compounds can take place during or, preferably, after the reaction. In the case of a subsequent conversion, the intermediate polymer can be iso- lated and purified first or converted directly. The conversion can be total or partial.</p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Preferably at least 10%, particularly preferably at least 20% and very particularly preferably at least 30% of the incorporated comonomers (b) are converted to the corresponding quaternary form. Usually up to 99%, particularly preferably up to 90% and very particularly preferably up to 80% of the incorporated comonomers (b) are con- verted to the corresponding quaternary form. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Preferably, the comonomers a) are used for the polymerization in predominantly catio- nogenic form, i.e. more than 70, preferably more than 90, particularly preferably more than 95 and very particularly preferably more than 99 mol% cationogenic, i.e. not in quaternized or protonated form, and only converted to the cationic or protonated form by quaternization during or, particularly preferably, after the polymerization. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In one preferred embodiment of the invention the resulting co-polymer is partially or completely protonated or quaternized only during or, particularly preferably, after the polymerization, because the comonomer a) used for the polymerization is preferably a comonomer that is only partially quaternized or protonated, if at all. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The comonomers a) can either be used in protonated or quaternized form or, preferably, polymerized in unquaternized or unprotonated form, the copolymer obtained in the latter case being either quaternized or protonated during or, preferably, after the polymerization for the use according to the invention. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 In the case where the comonomers are used in quaternized form, they can be used either as the dried substance, or in the form of concentrated solutions in solvents suitable for the comonomers, e.g. in polar solvents such as water, methanol, ethanol or acetone, or in the other co-monomer a) provided these are suitable as solvents. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">The resulting co-polymers may also be protonated. Examples of compounds suitable for the protonation are mineral acids such as HCI and H2SO4, monocarboxylic acids, e.g. formic acid and acetic acid, dicarboxylic acids and polyfunctional carboxylic acids, e.g. oxalic acid and citric acid, and any other proton-donating compounds and sub- stances that are capable of protonating the appropriate nitrogen atom. Water-soluble acids are particularly suitable for the protonation. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Possible organic acids which may be mentioned are optionally substituted monobasic and polybasic aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, optionally substituted monobasic and polybasic aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids or optionally substituted monobasic and polybasic aliphatic and aromatic phosphonic acids. Preferred organic acids are hydroxycarboxylic acids such as glycolic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid and citric acid, lactic acid being particularly preferred. Preferred inorganic acids which may be mentioned are phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid, sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid and hydro- chloric acid, phosphoric acid being particularly preferred. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The polymer may be protonated either directly after the polymerization or only when the respective pesticide is formulated, during which the pH is normally adjusted to a physiologically acceptable value. Protonation is understood as meaning that at least some of the protonatable groups of the polymer, preferably at least 20, preferably more than 50, particularly preferably more than 70 and very particularly preferably more than 90 mol%, are protonated, resulting in an overall cationic charge on the polymer. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">Examples of suitable reagents for quaternizing the compounds a) are alkyl halides hav- ing 1 to 24 C atoms in the alkyl group, e.g. methyl chloride, methyl bromide, methyl iodide, ethyl chloride, ethyl bromide, propyl chloride, hexyl chloride, dodecyl chloride, lauryl chloride, propyl bromide, hexyl bromide, octyl bromide, decyl bromide, dodecyl bromide , and benzyl halides, especially benzyl chloride and benzyl bromide. Quater- nization with long-chain alkyl radicals is preferably carried out with the corresponding alkyl bromides such as hexyl bromide, octylbromide, decylbromide, dodecyl bromide or lauryl bromide. Other suitable quaternizing agents are dialkyl sulfates, especially dimethyl sulfate or diethyl sulfate. The quaternization of the basic comonomers b) can also be carried out with alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide or propylene oxide, in the presence of acids. Preferred quaternizing agents are methyl chloride, dimethyl sulfate or diethyl sulfate, methyl chloride being particularly preferred. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 The quaternization of the comonomers or polymers with one of said quaternizing agents can be effected by generally known methods. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The acidic comonomer b) may comprise an acidic unit.

The agrochemical composition according to the invention may be very useful for the method for controlling phytopathogenic fungi and/or undesired plant growth and/or undesired attack by insects or mites and/or for regulating the growth of plants. Application can be carried out before or during sowing. Methods for applying or treating agrochemical compounds and compositions thereof, respectively, on to plant propagation material, especially seeds, are known in the art, and include dressing, coating, pelleting, dusting, soaking and in-furrow application methods of the propagation material. In a preferred embodiment, the compounds or the compositions thereof, respec- tively, are applied on to the plant propagation material by a method such that germination is not induced, e. g. by seed dressing, pelleting, coating and dusting. In a preferred embodiment, a suspension-type (FS) composition is used for seed treatment. Typically, a FS composition may comprise 1 -800 g/l of active substance, 1 -200 g/l Surfactant, 0 to 200 g/l antifreezing agent, 0 to 400 g/l of binder, 0 to 200 g/l of a pigment and up to 1 liter of a solvent, preferably water. </p><p id="p0109" num="0109">The active substances can be used as such or in the form of their compositions, e. g. in the form of directly sprayable solutions, suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, spreading, brushing, immersing or pouring. The application forms depend entirely on the intended purposes; it is intended to ensure in each case the finest possible distribution of the pesticides. The active substance concentrations in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied within relatively wide ranges. In general, they are from 0.0001 to 10%, preferably from 0.001 to 1 % by weight of active substance. The active substances may also be used successfully in the ultra-low-volume process (ULV), it being possible to apply compositions comprising over 95% by weight of active substance, or even to apply the active substance without additives. </p><p id="p0110" num="0110">When employed in plant protection, the amounts of active substances (also called pes- ticide) applied are, depending on the kind of effect desired, from 0.001 to 2 kg per ha, preferably from 0.005 to 2 kg per ha, more preferably from 0.05 to 0.9 kg per ha, in particular from 0.1 to 0.75 kg per ha. In treatment of plant propagation materials such 
<!-- EPO <DP n="19"/>-->
 as seeds, e. g. by dusting, coating or drenching seed, amounts of active substance of from 0.1 to 1000 g, preferably from 1 to 1000 g, more preferably from 1 to 100 g and most preferably from 5 to 100 g, per 100 kilogram of plant propagation material (preferably seed) are generally required. When used in the protection of materials or stored products, the amount of active substance applied depends on the kind of application area and on the desired effect. Amounts customarily applied in the protection of materials are, e. g., 0.001 g to 2 kg, preferably 0.005 g to 1 kg, of active substance per cubic meter of treated material. Various types of oils, wetters, adjuvants, herbicides, bactericides, other fungicides and/or pesticides may be added to the active substances or the compositions comprising them, if appropriate not until immediately prior to use (tank mix). These agents can be admixed with the compositions according to the invention in a weight ratio of 1 :100 to 100:1 , preferably 1 :10 to 10:1. Adjuvants which can be used are in particular organic modified polysiloxanes such as Break Thru S 240<sup>®</sup>; alcohol alkoxylates such as Atplus 245<sup>®</sup>, Atplus M BA 1303<sup>®</sup>, Plurafac LF 300<sup>®</sup> and Lutensol ON 30<sup>®</sup>; EO/PO block polymers, e. g. Pluronic RPE 2035<sup>®</sup> and Genapol B<sup>®</sup>; alcohol ethoxylates such as Lutensol XP 80<sup>®</sup>; and dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium such as Leophen RA<sup>®</sup>. The invention also relates to a use of the copolymer as dispersing agent in a composition (preferably an aqueous composition) containing a pesticide (preferably a water- insoluble pesticide). The dispersing agent increases usually the storage stability of the aqueous composition. Preferably, the storage stability of the water-insoluble pesticide is increased, which may be present in emulsified and/or suspended form in the aque- ous composition. Storage stability means that the degree of phase separation is visibly reduced upon storage (e.g. when stored at 20 °C for two weeks). Preferably, less coalescence, sedimentation or flocculation of the water-insoluble pesticide may be found upon storage. The present invention has various advantages: The copolymer has excellent capabilities for dispersing (e.g. emulsifying) water-insoluble pesticides in aqueous compositions, especially when the composition has a high concentration of salts, such as ionic pesticides. The invention enables the preparation of stable fluid pesticides concentrates, especially with high concentrations of ionic pesticides, which could not be pre- pared with conventional dispersing agent. It is also now possible to combine a high concentration of an ionic pesticide and a water-insoluble pesticide in one aqueous formulation. This combination of pesticides makes the handling easier for farmers: they have to use a single agrochemical formulation instead of several separate ones, and they have to meter only a single formulation instead of two or more separate formula- tions, and finally this provides additional logistic advantages. Earlier combinations of a high concentration of an ionic pesticide and a water-insoluble pesticide in one formula-
