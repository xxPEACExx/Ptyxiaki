In particular, when mass-producing such products in an industrial process it is difficult to achieve a consistent shape in each product. It is known in the prior art to impart a particular shape to a fruit product by jelling the fruit product. In order to cause the jelling, the product needs to be hot shaped at a temperature of between 60 and 100Ό. Such high temperatures can undesirably alter the flavor and color of a fruit-based product. In particular, the heating can result in a cooked taste, especially for red fruits. Therefore, the product obtained in such treatments does not have the natural taste and color of fruit. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004">US 2008/0138471 describes a chocolate-coated fruit paste.

 US 4961943 discloses coated fruit products. The products use dried unprocessed fruit pieces. Therefore the shape of the final products will be irregular and the coating will not be of a consistent thickness. It is also known to make superficially similar products in home baking. However, such recipes are not suitable for mass-production and do not contemplate the requirements for reproducible shaping or long term storage. Moreover, the strict fat content and Aw requirements are not a concern in home baking. Therefore, it would be desirable to be able to produce a regularly shaped fruit-based bite- size food product, in particular a mass-producible one, coated with chocolate or chocolatelike composition having a taste and color as natural as possible without any "cooked taste", whatever the fruit used. Accordingly, the present disclosure seeks to address at least some of the problems associated with the prior art, or at least provide a commercially useful alternative thereto. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In a first aspect the present disclosure provides a bite-size food product comprising: </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">a) a plastic solid soft fruit-based centre in the form of a 3-dimensional solid of revolution having: </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> an Aw of between 0.28 and 0.85; and </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> a fat content of less than 14% by weight based on the total weight of the fruit-based centre, and </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">b) a layer of a chocolate or chocolate-like composition coating the fruit-based centre, wherein the fruit-based centre is about 40-75% by weight of the total weight of the food product. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present disclosure will now be described further.

<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 The present inventors have found that it is possible to mass-produce a coated fruit-based product having a regular shape and desirable texture by controlling the active water and fat content of the fruit-based centre. The processing technique has been advantageously selected to allow the forming of consistent shapes having a soft texture without requiring an overly moist and sticky formulation. Moreover, because of the careful selection of these parameters and the processing conditions, the product is not associated with a cooked fruit flavour. Instead, the product has a fresh fruit flavour while having a long shelf-life and stability. A bite-sized food product is a food product suitably sized to be eaten in one or two bites by an adult. Therefore, advantageously, the total length of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure is &lt; 12 cm (an adult bite has its longest size &lt; 6 cm, and usually its second largest size &lt; 4cm, preferably &lt; 3.5 cm). Advantageously the total weight of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure is maximum 50g (i.e. a maximum of 25g per adult bite). </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">In particular the bite-size product according to the present disclosure preferably has a total weight of between 0.6 and 50g, in particular 1 to 35g, advantageously of between 1 and 25g, more advantageously of between 2.5 and 15g, still more advantageously of between 3 and 10g, even still more advantageously of between 3 and 7g, and in particular of between 3 and 5g. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016">The food product has a plastic solid soft fruit-based centre. These terms are well known in the art. A plastic solid is a material that is capable of being shaped or formed. In contrast, an elastic solid would not retain its shaped form and nor would a fluid centre. Soft centred foods are known in the art and confectionary is often marketed as soft-centred. Soft centred foods have advantageous organo-leptic properties and allow the product to reflect the texture properties of the natural fruit. Preferably, the centre has the consistency at room temperature similar to that of a typical modelling clay. That is, like modelling clay, it is possible to change the form of the centre by simply applying a hand-pressure, without the necessity to heat the product. Furthermore, like modelling clay, if no pressure is applied, the centre retains its shape and therefore does not flow. The centre is therefore malleable, deformable and can be hand-molded. It has the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
 workability of modeling clay and it is not too sticky or gummy to form and handle. However, contrary to modeling clay, the centre can contain discernable fruit pieces and, therefore, need not have only a fine texture. By "fruit-based" it is meant that the centre "contains fruits solids". Therefore, the fruit-based centre of the bite-size food product disclosed herein does not need to contain only fruit flavour.

These would be either too liquid or too sticky and a jam does not have the natural taste of fruit. Moreover, a jam introduces a cooked flavour in the final product. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024">The fruit-based centre according to the present disclosure does not consist of a single entire piece of classical dried fruits such as raisin, apricot or plum. This is because such pieces do not have a regular shape, i.e. a 3D solid of revolution shape. Moreover, they may be too small and when the Aw of a whole fruit piece is &lt; 0.55 to 0.6, they are too hard to chew and not juicy.

The water activity (Aw) of a product is a concept which is well known in the food industry field. This quantity, abbreviated as Aw, measures the availability of water in a sample. In most cases, this water activity is not proportional to the water content of the product. The methods with which the Aw of a product may be measured are known to the one skilled in the art. It can be measured for instance with an Aqualab CX-2 or series 3, or a Novasina. All Aw indicated here are measured at 25 +/-2Ό. </p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The Aw of the centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure is very important. If the Aw is above 0.85, the centre a) is too soft and too sticky to obtain the form wanted by a cold forming according to the disclosure. If the Aw is lower than 0.28, the centre is generally too hard to chew. While the addition of humectants can be used to mitigate against this problem, the mixture can become too sticky if a high amount of humectant is used. In addition, if the Aw is too high then the integrity of the chocolate or chocolate-like coating may be jeopardised. </p><p id="p0031" num="0031">The Aw is advantageously of between 0.28 and 0.72, more advantageously of between 0.4 and 0.7, still more advantageously of between 0.5 and 0.72, more particularly of 0.5-0.7, in another embodiment of 0.3-0.5, in a further embodiment of 0.7-0.77 or of 0.77-0.85. </p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Typical corresponding water content is 4 to 30% by weight based on the total weight of the centre, usually 6 to 26% by weight, preferably 7 to 22% by weight, more preferably 7 to 18% by weight.

Advantageously the centre has a density &gt; 1 , advantageously &gt; 1 .1 , more advantageously &gt; 1.15, in particular around 1 .2 when the Aw is below 0.5. In order to verify that the density is &gt; 1 , the easiest way is to put the centre in pure water at 20Ό and verify immediately that it sinks. In order to verify that the density is above 1.2, pure water can be replaced by a

The use of humectants helps to ensure that the centre remains chewable and has a pleasant mouthfeel, even when used with a low Aw product. The centre preferably contains up to 20% by weight of humectant based on the total weight of the fruit-based centre, advantageously between 4 and 28% by weight of humectants, more advantageously between 4 and 20% by weight of humectants, still more advantageously between 4 and 16% by weight of humectants. </p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The humectant preferably comprises one or more polyols, advantageously chosen in the group consisting of propylene glycol, monosaccharide polyols like glycerol, erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol and mannitol, disaccharide polyols like maltitol and lactitol, and mixture thereof, more advantageously one or more monosaccharide polyols, in particular glycerol, sorbitol or mixture thereof, still more advantageously glycerol. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Where polyols are used as humectant it is advantageous that their amount is not too high. This is because of the potential laxative effects of polyols where the final bite-size food product contains 10% by weight or more of polyols based on the total weight of the food product. </p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The fruit-based centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure is not gelled. More advantageously it does not contain any gelatine or any gelatinized starch. Advantageously the centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure does not contain any additives, like alginate, agar, xanthan or added pectin (which are not naturally present in the fruit-based centre), these additives being added for their gelling function. </p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The fruit-based centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure can contain some bulking agent, such as, for example, non-gelatinized starch, maltodextrin, fibres like poly-dextrose or mixture thereof, advantageously in the amount of up to 40% by weight based on the total weight of the fruit-based centre, more advantageously between 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
 15 and 27% by weight. In particular the fruit-based centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure contains non-gelatinized starch, preferably non- gelatinized native starch. Unlike maltodextrins, non-gelatinized native starch absorbs very little saliva in the mouth and therefore does not increase the stickiness of the centre. Furthermore, as native starch is a non-modified natural product, it is not part of food additives, which have to be reported as such on the package of the marketed product. In addition, native starch does not have any digestive drawbacks, unlike most polyols which have a strong laxative effect. The fact that it is not cooked makes natural starch slowly digestible, which allows a reduction of the glycemic index of the food product according to the present disclosure. Thus, addition of non-gelatinized native starch in the centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure causes as an additional effect a sensation of satiety which is extended relatively to products containing simple sugars. </p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The grain size of granules of native starches, which is generally comprised between 2 μιη and 100 μιη, and more generally between 5 μιη and 45 μιη, is also ideal for a use in the centre of the food product according to the disclosure. Thus, native starches neither comprise too many fine particles nor too many large particles, except maybe potato which has coarser granules up to 100 μιη. The balance between small size and large size granules may, if needed, be adjusted according to the sought textures and properties, by mixing in different proportions, starches from various origins. In an advantageous embodiment, the particle size (mean longest diameter) of the starch is for at least 90% of the particles, comprised between 2μιη and 100 μιη, preferably between 5 μιη and 45 μιη. Among native starches, wheat starch is preferred, because it has an ideal grain size from 2 μιη to 45 μιη, and because it is a natural constituent in cereal baked products, which are mainly based on wheat flour, moreover often mixed with wheat starch. Maize and manioc starches are also part of the preferred starches because of their grain size. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044">Other advantages of native starch are its neutral flavor and its white color, which allows the fruit-based centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure to

 assume the taste and the color of the fruit in case of fruit-based centre. Finally, native starch is an inexpensive ingredient. It may normally be used without any grinding in the centre according to the disclosure, which allows a simplified making process and larger productivity. </p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The fruit-based centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure can contain some added sugars, i.e. sugars which are not initially present in the fruit material. By "sugar or sugars", is intended to mean in the sense of the present disclosure the dry matter of any mono- and disaccharides, whatever the source and also by extension all the dry matter of the glucose syrup, also called glucose-fructose syrup or fructose-glucose syrup. Among monosaccharides mention may be made of fructose, galactose, glucose, mannose and mixture thereof. Among disaccharides, mention may notably be made of saccharose, but saccharose may be partly or totally replaced with another disaccharide such as lactose or maltose. Glucose syrup contains mono and disaccharides, but also some longer chains of polymerized dextrose.

The acid can enhance the flavour of the fruit-based centre. Other flavouring agents, colouring agent, seasoning agent and salt can be added with a total amount for all these ingredients of up to 5% by weight based on the total weight of the fruit-based centre for sweet products, and up to 10% for savoury products, that can contain higher amounts of spices &amp; herbs for instance.

Preferred crispy pieces include nut pieces </p><p id="p0049" num="0049">(hazelnuts, almonds, peanut, walnut, pistachio, cashew for example), chocolate pieces (vermicelli, drops for example) or grain (sesame, flax for example) inclusions. If the Aw of the fruit-based centre is lower or equal to 0.6, these crispy pieces can be made from cereals or other crispy pieces that would lose their crispiness at Aw above 0.6 (crunchy caramel pieces for example). Of course, different crispy pieces can be mixed. These crispy pieces are not taken into account for calculating the fat content and/or the fruit solid content of the fruit-based centre but are taking into account for the calculation of the centre weight relative to the total product weight. </p><p id="p0050" num="0050">In an advantageous embodiment of the present disclosure, the fruit-based centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure is cold formed at a temperature of less than 60Ό, preferably less than 50Ό, more preferably 0-50Ό, more advantageously 0-4013, still more advantageously 4-35<sup>c</sup>C and in par ticular at 20±10Ό.

Preferred fruits regarding texture are cranberry, raisin (golden or black), apricot which can all be used alone or in mixes. Apples are often more dry, less cohesive and are better to be used in blend with the previous fruits. Cranberries are very useful as their bitterness and astringency hide any too sweet taste and their color is beautiful.

 Tomato, red bell pepper and pumpkin can also be used. </p><p id="p0099" num="0099">However, other fruit sources (fruit paste made from grinding of dried or semi-dried fruits, concentrated fruit puree made from whole fruit by evaporation under vacuum heating, concentrated juices usually made after removal of at least part of the particles in suspension containing fibers, or fruit powders) could be used, preferably as a complement to dried or infused fruits, but also as the main fruit source. </p><p id="p0100" num="0100">Citrus like are less suitable as main fruit solid source, because of their low solid / fiber content and their high acidity.

The advantage of this is that the fruit seems more natural and the process is simpler. The weight % of humectants and sugars will be adjusted to match the Aw target. Sugars can be added in powder, or in syrup (containing usually -18% by weight of water). </p><p id="p0104" num="0104">Food acid (preferably citric or malic acid) can be added (typically 0.3 to 1 % by weight based on the total weight of the fruit-based centre) to enhance the flavor. </p><p id="p0105" num="0105">Fruit juices (preferably in a concentrated form) can be used either for taste or coloring (red or dark elderberries, or all the berries or currants: blackcurrant, redcurrant for example). </p><p id="p0106" num="0106">The mincing of the fruits pieces used in the fruit-based center can be made: </p><p id="p0107" num="0107"> a) before the mixing with other ingredients to make the fruit preparation.

 b) during the mixing with other ingredients ("all in" process, using an extruder for instance) </p><p id="p0108" num="0108"> c) after the mixing: the ingredients are first mixed, then the mixture is minced together in a meat grinder </p><p id="p0109" num="0109">Step a) can be done by the fruit supplier, but preferably in the final factory. </p><p id="p0110" num="0110"> The mixing and mincing of the ingredients can therefore be carried out at the same time or successively. Advantageously the mincing, in particular with a meat grinder, of step 1 ) is carried out before and/or after the mixing, more advantageously before and after mixing. In a particular embodiment, a first cutting can be made by the fruit supplier: it consist to reduce the size of the whole fruit (which can be big: apricot, apple for example) in pieces of mean size below the diameter of the fruit-based centre, and preferably below half of this size. Then the fruits pieces obtained are mixed with other ingredients, and the second mincing enable to finish the size reduction, while releasing some sugars to improve the internal cohesion of the centre during following forming. </p><p id="p0111" num="0111">The mincing step reduces the fruit pieces to fit the final center size. More importantly, it also gives a less hard / chewy / leathery texture to the mixture obtained and therefore the consistency of modeling clay. It also helps to have a good balance between the internal cohesion (necessary for the forming and solidity after forming) and external stickiness, which may disturb the forming. </p><p id="p0112" num="0112">Mincing may be an important step: if the fruit pieces are bought already chopped with the right granulometry directly from the supplier, it may not be possible to just form them (without further mincing), as the product obtained will not be cohesive enough. This is due to the fact that the supplier usually adds a small % of anti-caking agents (oil, starch, sugars for example). Mincing exudes some sticky liquid sugars and disperses the anti-caking agents, which enables the internal cohesion. However, if the mincing is too much, external stickiness can occurs and give problems for the later forming. </p><p id="p0113" num="0113">Any conventional mixer can be used for mixing the ingredients, for instance planetary, or with 1 or preferably 2 horizontal shafts like Z-Arm mixer.

 Advantageously, it is simpler to start from partly hot infused dried fruits. An example is cranberries, which can not be found without added sugars in such food form. Commercial dried cranberries are infused by at least sugar, and often also with glycerol (to make them softer) and eventually other soluble components, and can have an Aw for instance from 0.45 to 0.62. They can be processed with a single meat grinder which kneads, minces and extrudes a cylinder, like for making sausages. </p><p id="p0114" num="0114">To have a softer texture, it is possible to pass the product 2 times in the grinder: first time without the "sausage" extruding exit, to just mince / knead the fruits, and the second time with the sausage extruding exit to further mince and form the cylinder at the same time. Therefore in a particular embodiment of the process according to the present disclosure, the mincing of the ingredients and in particular of the fruit part of step 1 a) is carried out at least once, and advantageously at least twice. The second sub-step 1 b) necessary for preparing the fruit-based centre of the bite-size product according to the present disclosure consists in cold forming the product obtained in step 1 a) at a temperature below 60Ό. </p><p id="p0115" num="0115">The shape is a solid of revolution, preferably a ball (=quite round product). This ball shape can be obtained from a "boilies table": this is a forming device well known to make round carp fishing baits called "boilies", made of a dough containing a cereal flour and eggs; the obtained balls are then cooked by frying, and then dried. Such a table, called "TABLE DES FRERES MAHIN" is available from Starbaits company </p><p id="p0116" num="0116"> (http://www.starbaits.com/fr/article/table-des-freres-mahin.50.html). This table converts a cylinder into balls of the same diameter than the cylinder. Other shaping machines include the rolling machines made by Krijger and Salecker™, such as the ARM 0250+600. This is able to extrude a cylinder of fruit centre material and divide it into balls using a line of cutters with a crescent profile. The first step is to extrude a cylinder (or much less preferred other forms like </p><p id="p0117" num="0117">parallelepiped) from the grinded mixture obtained in step 1 a), cutting it to the length suitable for the "boilies table". The second step is to place one or several cylinder on the table, and convert it into balls by an alternative translating movement of the upper side of the table, the lower side being fixed. The diameter of the boilies table channels makes the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="23"/>-->
 diameter of the final balls. The diameter of the extrusion cylinder must be close to the one of the boilies table, to make balling more efficient. </p><p id="p0118" num="0118">To change the diameter, it is necessary to change the diameter of the hemi cylinder channels of both top and bottom part of the boilies table, as well as the diameter of the extruded cylinder. Various boilies table sizes exist, enabling ball sizes between at least from 8 to 32 mm, by step of 2 mm. </p><p id="p0119" num="0119">More generally for a solid of revolution: the grinded mixture obtained in step 1 a) is first divided in pre-forms which are sent one by one in between 2 parallel surfaces, defining a close section which has the wanted shape (a disc for a final ball shape). The surfaces are quite parallel to make a channel (a hole cylinder for a ball shape). The 2 surfaces have a differential speed (usually, 1 surface is fixed and the other moving), making the dough preform roll in between these 2 surfaces: this produces the solid of revolution. The pre-form size must be adapted to the volume defined by the 2 surfaces. Usually, several channels are in parallel, in order to make several forms at the same time. </p><p id="p0120" num="0120">In a particular advantageous embodiment, steps 1 a) and 1 b) are carried out between 0 and 50Ό. Usually, step 1 a) is made at a final temperat ure of 10-50Χ, preferably 20-35Ό, and step 1 b) at 0-50Χ, preferably 0 to 40Ό, advantage ously 4 to 35Ό and more preferably 20 +/- 10 Ό. </p><p id="p0121" num="0121">Therefore the taste of a fruit-based centre obtained using this process is good because fruits are not heated at high temperature during the fruit centre preparation of step 1 ). So it does not take any "cooked" fruit taste, like in jams or "pates de fruits". Furthermore, its color is preserved. </p><p id="p0122" num="0122">Softness of the fruit-based centre can come from the humectants (glycerol / sugars) and the water, but also from the fruit pieces mincing. In case no glycerol / high fruit content is used, pieces must be cut in smaller pieces to be softer / less chewy, and Aw is better to be selected in the upper ranger of 0.28-0.6 (0.54 for instance) when water sensible crispy pieces are present, or at higher Aw (for instance 0.7) when no water sensible crispy pieces are present.

 Stickiness is critical for the forming process step 1 b). Optimum stickiness depends on the forming process and material. Stickiness must be adapted (not too low, but not too high) for the balling (or other forming) by: </p><p id="p0123" num="0123"> - careful choice of the ingredients: more water, glycerol and liquid sugars make the product stickier. Powders, including fruit powder, especially apple powder, as well as fat, decrease stickiness. The stickiness is also probably driven by the microstructure (having the glycerol outside the pieces, in the free phase, make it stickier than when infused in fruit pieces). </p><p id="p0124" num="0124"> - the process used and in particular: </p><p id="p0125" num="0125"><sup>■</sup> in step 1 a : preparation of the centre: </p><p id="p0126" num="0126"> a resting time, a colder temperature (well known for its impact on glass transition Tg) and less mincing / kneading make the product less sticky.

In case a plastic boilies table is used for the forming step, the product is: </p><p id="p0135" num="0135"> - Not enough sticky when it slips and cannot form balls (this is for instance the case if some oil is sprayed on the table) </p><p id="p0136" num="0136"> - Too sticky when pieces are spread, with some product build up on the table. </p><p id="p0137" num="0137"> Fat content and forming temperature have to be adjusted with the Aw, as stickiness and softness generally increase with Aw.

 As a guideline: </p><p id="p0138" num="0138"> • Aw 0.28 - 0.50 : forming is optimal with 0-5% fat (any fat, but preferably palm oil)</p><p id="p0139" num="0139">• Aw 0.5 - 0.70: forming is optimal with 3-6% fat (any fat, but preferably palm oil) For Aw 0.7 to 0.77, the texture is softer. Therefore, it requires a "solid" fat to ensure consistency, with preferably 6-14% fat. As a consequence, a solid fat (palm oil, butter, hydrogenated coconut or equivalent) and in addition a temperature of the centre &lt; 20 to 25Ό at the balling/forming stage are used. For Aw 0.77 to 0.85, this is even softer. </p><p id="p0140" num="0140">Therefore, 10 to 14% of a solid fat are needed and a cooling &lt; 10Ό is mandatory between the cylinder forming and balling. </p><p id="p0141" num="0141">Advantageously, after step 1 a) there is a resting time before performing step 1 b), at either room or refrigerated temperature. More advantageously the resting time is from 4H to 6 months, still more advantageously from 4 to 72H, and even still more advantageously from 8 to 24H. In case fat is added during step 1 ), it is advantageously non hydrogenated fat, for instance palm oil. In a preferred embodiment, this is a hard fat, containing more than 35% Safa, preferably more than 42%, and more preferably from 45 to 55%. </p><p id="p0142" num="0142">In another embodiment of the fruit-based centre preparation step 1 ): </p><p id="p0143" num="0143">- 2 quite concentric fruit preparation are used in the centre.

Advantageously, because the fruit-based centre is sticky and difficult to handle, in the process according to the present disclosure, there is no bulk storage of the formed centre obtained in step 1 ) before carrying out step 2). Bulk storage will lead the centres to stick together, making centre deformation or making further use more difficult. Step 2) of the process according to the present disclosure consists in enrobing the fruit- based centre obtained in step 1 ) with a melted chocolate or chocolate-like composition and let the chocolate or chocolate-like composition set by cooling in order to form the layer b). By melted it is meant that the chocolate or chocolate-like composition is not in its final set

It does not infer a need for an active melting step, for example, where the composition is freshly made from the raw component ingredients. </p><p id="p0145" num="0145">The viscosity of the melted chocolate or chocolate-like composition can be adapted to the required coating thickness, as known by the chocolate maker. The chocolate or chocolatelike composition is either tempered or not. In an advantageous embodiment the real chocolate is tempered, and the chocolate-analog is pre-crystallized. In fact this will ensure quicker crystallization of the chocolate/chocolate analog coating and therefore a shorter step 2). Preferably the coating thickness is from 0.1 to 10mm, more preferably from 0.5 to 7.5mm, more preferably from 1 to 5mm and most preferably about 2mm. </p><p id="p0146" num="0146">In an advantageous embodiment step 2) is carried out with a conventional enrober, a chocolate coating pan (preferred version) or any other suitable process known by the chocolate maker (dipping for example). </p><p id="p0147" num="0147">Advantageously, in the case of an enrober, only one coating is carried out in step 2) (less fat % in the final bite-size food product according to the present disclosure), but it is also possible to carry out 2 coatings for more chocolate or chocolate-like composition in the final bite-size food product according to the present disclosure. In this case, a cooling step is required in between the 2 coatings steps. </p><p id="p0148" num="0148">Advantageously due to the stickiness of the fruit-based centre, it is important that at the entrance of the enrober, the centres are separated from each other, to enable a full enrobing with the chocolate or chocolate-like composition and avoid "doubles or multiples" final products. This separation can be done by hand if necessary. </p><p id="p0149" num="0149">Advantageously, the enrobing step 2) is carried out by chocolate panning, advantageously, using a rotating coating pan. 2 types of equipments can for instance be used as rotative pan: conventional rotating pan or Finn Coater. Such batch equipments are sold for instance by Dumoulin (Z.I. Le Closeau, 5 rue Auguste Perdonnet, 77220 TOURNAN-EN-BRIE, FRANCE). To avoid ball sticking together before the chocolate or chocolate-like composition coating, the fruit-based balls centre fall in the coating pan ideally already under rotation. The speed of the pan can be

 increased at the beginning, until the balls are not sticking anymore because covered with enough chocolate. </p><p id="p0150" num="0150">Alternatively, an enrober (not preferred version) +cooling tunnel can be used instead of the rotating pan.

Advantageously it is packed hermetically in a conventional way. Preferably transparent packs are used to see the product. To protect the product during logistics, individual wrapping of pieces, or flow pack of a few pieces, or boxes with trays can be used. Shelf life varies depending on Aw, because some yeast and moulds can develop at the highest Aw as this is known by a skilled person. For Aw 0.28 to 0.72, and especially 0.28 to 0.6, an indicative shelf life is generally 1 to 18 months, preferably 2 to 12, preferably 4 to 9 ideally 6 to 9 months at 0 to 30Ό, preferably 0 to 27 and preferably 10 to 25Ό and even preferably 10 to 20Ό. Most of these conditions usu ally do not require preservatives,

 although some may be used when Aw is above 0.58. For Aw 0.72 to 0.85, preservatives in the fruit based centre and / or a reduce shelf life (no more than 7 months at 20Ό, and for instance 1 week to 1 month for the highest Aw) and/or a refrigerated keeping (0 to 10Ό) will be used to avoid any spoilage. </p><p id="p0154" num="0154">The present inventors have found that it is especially preferred that the fruit centre has a minced semi-dried fruit core. The Aw of such a core is preferably less than 0.75. Since this low Aw would lead to a firmer core than would be desirable, the centre further comprises one or more humectants. Preferably the centre comprises 4-16% humectants by weight of the centre. This gives a soft texture having an excellent storage stability</p><p id="p0155" num="0155">(generally at least 6 months at room temperature). It is desirable for the fruit centre to be minced because this provides a softer texture and a meat-grinder is ideal for providing such a texture.
