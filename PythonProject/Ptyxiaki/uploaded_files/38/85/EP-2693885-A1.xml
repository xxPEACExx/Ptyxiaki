In dairy products, contamination with yeast and molds may limit the shelf life of the dairy products. One product area experiencing significant yeast and mold contamination problems includes fresh cheeses. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">Bioprotective solutions to overcome these problems have been developed by the dairy industry. Some of the most well-known and probably most commonly used antifungal bioprotective solutions on the market are the HOLDBAC™ YM-b and HOLDBAC™ YM-C cultures from Danisco that both contain combinations of subspecies of Propionibacteria and Lactobacillus. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">The use of propionic acid bacteria together with lactic acid bacteria for inhibition of microorganisms has been disclosed in the patent applications US 2005/0095318 and WO 2004/041305. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Propionibacteria ssp. are believed to contribute to the antifungal activity mainly through the production of propionic acid but also through the production of acetic acid and other metabolites. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">However, these species are rather costly to produce in an industrial scale and the production of propionic acid may cause unwanted sensory properties in the final dairy products. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Other antifungal bioprotective solutions on the market for dairy products include Lyofast LPRA from SACCO as well as Aroma-Prox®RP80 from BIOPROX. Both of these products contain combinations of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus.

 Tharmaraj and Shah (2009) describe the screening for bioprotective lactic acid bacterial candidates for cheese-based dips. All strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus paracasei tested as single strains showed maximum inhibitory effect against yeasts and molds. However, no combinations of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus paracasei were examined. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Thus, there is an industrial need to develop improved bioprotective solutions which omit Propionibacteria ssp. without compromising the antifungal effectiveness. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">The present inventors have identified new strains of lactic acid bacteria which are significantly effective in inhibiting the growth of bacterial and fungal microorganisms that are known to occur as contaminants in milk and dairy products. The present inventors have further found that a certain group of lactic acid bacteria when combined with another group of lactic acid bacteria exhibit a significant synergistic antimicrobial effect. The antimicrobial effect of the two groups of bacteria combined, surprisingly, is greater than the sum of the individual effects of the two groups of bacteria. </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">Thus, a first aspect of the present invention relates to an antimicrobial composition comprising at least one strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and at least one strain of Lactobacillus paracasei. In a preferred embodiment, said antimicrobial composition comprises</p><p id="p0015" num="0015">(a) at least one Lactobacillus strain selected from the group consisting of Lactobacillus rhamnosus CHCC12697 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CHCC14226 and mutants thereof and</p><p id="p0016" num="0016">(b) at least one Lactobacillus paracasei strain selected from the group consisting of Lactobacillus paracasei CHCC12777 and mutant strains thereof. In another preferred embodiment, the present invention provides an antimicrobial composition which comprises at least one strain selected from the group consisting of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain CHCC12697, Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain CHCC14226, Lactobacillus paracasei strain CHCC12777, and mutant strains thereof, wherein the mutant strains are obtained by using the deposited strain as a starting material. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">The compositions of the invention provide the advantage that unwanted microorganisms selected from fungi, bacteria and mixtures thereof, for example on food, feed and pharmaceutical products and in humans and animals, can be inhibited . The prevention and/or inhibition of the growth of fungi, such as yeasts and molds, is particularly envisaged. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the term "antimicrobial" is to be understood as "antifungal". 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
 Therefore, a second aspect of the present invention is directed to use of one of the antimicrobial compositions of the first aspect in the preparation of a food, feed or pharmaceutical product. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">A third aspect relates to the use of one of the antimicrobial compositions of the first aspect for inhibiting the growth of unwanted microorganisms selected from the group consisting of fungi, bacteria and mixtures thereof. In particular, the compositions of the invention shall be used for inhibiting and/or preventing the growth of fungi and bacteria which are commonly known contaminants in dairy industry processes, such as in milk fermentation processes. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A fourth aspect relates to the use of one of the antimicrobial compositions of the first aspect as a pharmaceutical product. The pharmaceutical product is preferably for use in treating an infection of a subject by bacteria or fungi, more preferably molds. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020">A fifth aspect relates to a food, feed or pharmaceutical product comprising one of the antimicrobial compositions according to the first aspect of the present invention. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021">A sixth aspect of the present invention is directed to a method for manufacturing the food, feed or pharmaceutical product according to the fifth aspect of the invention, the method comprising adding one of the antimicrobial compositions according to the first aspect of the present invention during the manufacture of the food, feed or pharmaceutical product. Where the method includes the addition of an antimicrobial composition which comprises a Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain in combination with a Lactobacillus paracasei strain, said composition is added such that the concentration of the at least one strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and the at least one strain of Lactobacillus paracasei is each at least 1x10<sup>s</sup> cfu/g, preferably 5x10<sup>s</sup> cfu/g, or each at least lxlO<sup>6</sup> cfu/ml, preferably 5xl0<sup>6</sup> cfu/ml of the food, feed or pharmaceutical product, or each at least lxlO<sup>5</sup> cfu/cm<sup>2</sup>, preferably lxlO<sup>7</sup> cfu/cm<sup>2</sup>, of the surface of the food, feed or pharmaceutical product, and manufacturing parameters are controlled during the manufacturing such that the concentration of the at least one strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and the at least one strain of Lactobacillus paracasei increases or remains constant. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022">In a seventh aspect the present invention relates to a Lactobacillus rhamnosus CHCC12697 strain that was deposited with the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) under accession no.

The industrially most useful lactic acid bacteria are found within the order "Lactobacillales" which includes Lactococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pseudoleuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp., 
<!-- EPO <DP n="9"/>-->
 Brevibacterium spp. and Enterococcus spp. These are frequently used as food cultures alone or in combination with other lactic acid bacteria . </p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Lactic acid bacteria, including bacteria of the species Lactobacillus sp. and Streptococcus thermophilus, are normally supplied to the dairy industry either as frozen or freeze-dried cultures for bulk starter propagation or as so-called "Direct Vat Set" (DVS) cultures, intended for direct inoculation into a fermentation vessel or vat for the production of a dairy product, such as a fermented milk product or a cheese. Such lactic acid bacterial cultures are in general referred to as "starter cultures" or "starters". </p><p id="p0039" num="0039">The term "mesophile" herein refers to microorganisms that thrive best at moderate temperatures ( 15°C-40°C). The industrially most useful mesophilic bacteria include Lactococcus spp. and Leuconostoc spp. The term "mesophilic fermentation" herein refers to fermentation at a temperature between about 22°C and about 35°C. The term "mesophilic fermented milk product" refers to fermented milk products prepared by mesophilic fermentation of a mesophilic starter culture and include such fermented milk products as buttermilk, sour milk, cultured milk, smetana, sour cream and fresh cheese, such as quark, tvarog and cream cheese. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The term "thermophile" herein refers to microorganisms that thrive best at temperatures above 43°C. The industrially most useful thermophilic bacteria include Streptococcus spp. and Lactobacillus spp. The term "thermophilic fermentation" herein refers to fermentation at a temperature above about 35°C, such as between about 35°C to about 45°C. The term "thermophilic fermented milk product" refers to fermented milk products prepared by thermophilic fermentation of a thermophilic starter culture and include such fermented milk products as set-yoghurt, stirred-yoghurt and drinking yoghurt. </p><p id="p0041" num="0041">The term "milk" is to be understood as the lacteal secretion obtained by milking any mammal, such as cows, sheep, goats, buffaloes or camels. In a preferred embodiment, the milk is cow's milk. The term milk also includes protein/fat solutions made of plant materials, e.g . soy milk. </p><p id="p0042" num="0042">The term "milk substrate" may be any raw and/or processed milk material that can be subjected to fermentation according to the method of the invention. Thus, useful milk substrates include, but are not limited to, solutions/suspensions of any milk or milk-like products comprising protein, such as whole or low fat milk, skim milk, buttermilk, reconstituted milk powder, condensed milk, dried milk, whey, whey permeate, lactose, mother liquid from crystallization of lactose, whey protein concentrate, or cream. Obviously, the milk substrate may originate from any mammal, e.g. being substantially pure mammalian milk, or reconstituted milk powder. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
 Prior to fermentation, the milk substrate may be homogenized and pasteurized according to methods known in the art. </p><p id="p0043" num="0043">"Homogenizing" as used herein means intensive mixing to obtain a soluble suspension or emulsion. If homogenization is performed prior to fermentation, it may be performed so as to break up the milk fat into smaller sizes so that it no longer separates from the milk. This may be accomplished by forcing the milk at high pressure through small orifices. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044">"Pasteurizing" as used herein means treatment of the milk substrate to reduce or eliminate the presence of live organisms, such as microorganisms. Preferably, pasteurization is attained by maintaining a specified temperature for a specified period of time. The specified temperature is usually attained by heating. The temperature and duration may be selected in order to kill or inactivate certain bacteria, such as harmful bacteria . A rapid cooling step may follow. </p><p id="p0045" num="0045">"Fermentation" in the methods of the present invention means the conversion of carbohydrates into alcohols or acids through the action of a microorganism. Preferably, fermentation in the methods of the invention comprises conversion of lactose to lactic acid. </p><p id="p0046" num="0046">Fermentation processes to be used in production of dairy products are well known and the person of skill in the art will know how to select suitable process conditions, such as temperature, oxygen, amount and characteristics of microorganism(s) and process time. Obviously, fermentation conditions are selected so as to support the achievement of the present invention, i.e. to obtain a dairy product in solid (such as a cheese) or liquid form (such as a fermented milk product). </p><p id="p0047" num="0047">The term "unwanted microorganisms" herein refers to microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi, such as yeasts, which are pathogenic and/or able to deteriorate food, feed or pharmaceutical products. </p><p id="p0048" num="0048">The terms "to inhibit" and "to be inhibiting" in relation to unwanted microorganisms mean for example that the growth or the number or the concentration of unwanted microorganisms, for example in food products and/or on the surface of food products comprising the antimicrobial composition, is lower than in food products and/or on the surface of food products which does not comprise such an antimicrobial composition. </p><p id="p0049" num="0049">In the present context, the term "mutant" should be understood as a strain derived from a strain of the invention by means of e.g. genetic engineering, radiation and/or chemical
