Stressors can be of infectious or non-infectious origin. Examples of stressors are microorganisms (viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitical) or non-endogenous proteins or peptide-related materials which have invaded a tissue locally, physical traumas including surgery, severe blood loss, extracorporal circulation or extensive soft tissue damage and multiple fractures, ischemia/reperfusion events, or damage to cells or tissue due to burns, chemotherapy, radiation or intoxication. During the inflammatory reaction, many factors play a role. Inflammatory mediators, including acute- phase proteins, interleukins, prostaglandins, cytokines and leukotrienes, contribute to a concerted number of responses within the body in order to obtain an appropriate metabolism and host defence reaction (i.e. blood flow to the affected tissue, repair processes and combat against undesired exogenous components and apoptosis of endogenous cells) in order to obtain an appropriate host defence-reaction, in particular to rapidly and effectively neutralise stressors, obtain rapid wound healing, prevent tissue damage as caused by ischemia/- reperfusion processes or chemo- or radiotherapy and achieve a fast repair of tissue function. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advances in medical care, a dysregulated systemic inflammatory response remains a major complication in surgical, trauma and critically ill patients, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Modulation of the early excessive inflammatory response represents a potential therapeutic option to improve outcome. Although experimental studies demonstrated promising results of interventions aimed at inhibition of single pro-inflammatory mediators, clinical implementation has failed to be successful. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 Enhanced insight in disease pathology and development of novel treatment modalities which broadly affect the inflammatory response are warranted to reduce morbidity and mortality. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> Patients that are subjected to surgery are mostly fasted prior to surgery in order to prevent potential vomiting and aspiration of stomach contents. In addition, patients often experience serious problems in feeding themselves properly in the period directly after surgery. Statistics demonstrate that many hospitalised patients suffer from complications. Such complications vary from delayed wound healing, swelling and pain, bad recovery of function of the stressed tissue, local infections, and may in some instances even result in systemic complications like sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction, which are aggravated by decreased nutritional intake. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> Recently, early enteral administration before or after surgery of nutrients was shown to improve immune competence and clinical outcome in surgical and critically ill patients (ref. 8- 10). </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> Enteral feeding of patients during surgery is known for patients suffering from severe burn injuries (ref. 48-49). However, the feeding is not performed to mitigate, attenuate or prevent an acute inflammatory response during or after surgery but to meet their significant nutritional demands, reduce caloric deficit and because such patients cannot be fed otherwise. Furthermore, surgery is limited to skin surgery, i.e. non-invasive surgery. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> Hence, until now, it has not been proposed to routinely feed patients during surgery, i.e. intra-operatively, in order to mitigate, attenuate or prevent an acute inflammatory response during or after surgery and which nutritional composition would be best suited for such purpose. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">SUMMARY OF THE I VENTION </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> It is a purpose of the invention to provide a liquid nutritional composition for mitigating, attenuating or preventing an acute inflammatory response during or after surgery, preferably invasive surgery, of patients who are at risk for or are already experiencing complications as a result of these stressors, by intra-operative enteral administration of a lipid- and protein-rich liquid nutritional composition, more in particular by intra-operative tube feeding, in particular by continuous intra-operative tube feeding. It is also an object to provide a method for mitigating, attenuating or preventing an acute inflammatory response during or after surgery, preferably invasive surgery, of patients who are at risk for or are already experiencing complications as a 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 result of these stressors, by intra-operative enteral administration of a lipid- and protein-rich liquid nutritional composition, more in particular by intra-operative tube feeding, in particular by continuous intra-operative tube feeding. The administration of said enteral nutrition is practical to apply by the use of known enteral feeding devices, in particular tubes, and prevents in particular the development of a (too) strong or dysregulated inflammatory response during and following the presence of the stressor and the subsequent healing process by a rapid mode of action. When the inflammatory reaction has already started, it prevents a further increase of the inflammatory reaction, a so-called hyperinflammation. A reduction of the hyperinflammatory response has been associated with an enhanced recovery after surgery. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> Hence, the problem to be solved by the invention is to provide a liquid nutritional composition capable of rapidly averting short-time inflammatory effects, in particular with a surgical medical intervention, preferably an invasive surgical medical intervention. An invasive surgical medical intervention is one which penetrates or breaks the skin or enters a body cavity. Examples of invasive procedures include those that involve perforation, an incision, a catheterization, or other entry into the body. An specific invasive surgical medical intervention is an open surgery cutting skin and tissues so the surgeon has a direct access to the structures or organs involved. The structures and tissues involved can be seen and touched, and they are directly exposed to the air of the operating room.

Without being bound by theory, the lipid-rich nutrition is beneficial for attenuating or preventing an acute inflammatory response and organ damage via a cholecystokinin (CCK)-mediated vagovagal reflex. It is also believed that protein is beneficial for attenuating or preventing an acute inflammatory response and organ damage via a cholecystokinin (CCK)-mediated vagovagal reflex. The fat provides a fast and high CCK response whereas the protein delivers a lower but more sustainable CCK release. Surprisingly, both responses together deliver the optimal mediation of the cholecystokinin-mediated vagovagal reflex. In addition, the high amount of protein provides the necessary amino acids (in particular glutamine) for the recovery of patients, in particular by (i) minimizing catabolic protein response,

Our data reveal that enriched nutrition modulates the innate immune response during human endotoxemia, resulting in attenuated plasma levels of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-IRA and elevated circulating IL-10, indicating a reduced pro-inflammatory response and an augmented anti-inflammatory response. During the last decades, the catabolic state of surgical and critically ill patients increasingly gained interest [23, 24]. </p><p id="p0156" num="0156">The observed negative correlation between catabolism and clinical outcome resulted in more liberal nutritional regimes, such as reduced pre-operative fasting and early administration of enteral nutrition [24]. Implementation of these renewed nutritional support regimes reduced morbidity and length of hospital stay [9, 10]. Although the exact mechanisms behind these 
<!-- EPO <DP n="25"/>-->
 beneficial effects are not well known, it is assumed that adequate nutritional support prevents immunodeficiency induced by caloric deficits [25]. In addition to caloric support, prolonged ingestion of nutrition enriched with intrinsic anti-inflammatory compounds, such as long-chain n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and glutamine results in immune-modulating effects and improves outcome by influencing specific metabolic processes, including eicosanoid production, glutathione synthesis and generation of heat shock proteins [26, 27]. In a previous study, enteral lipid-enriched nutrition was shown to limit inflammation and reduce organ damage via a CCK- mediated activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in several rodent models [16- 19, 28]. </p><p id="p0157" num="0157">Virtually every surgical, trauma and ICU patient suffers from systemic inflammation. The complex interplay between pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms during such a systemic inflammatory response is still incompletely understood [29]. The human endotoxemia model does not replicate these clinical conditions, but has been extensively employed to study the acute systemic inflammatory response in vivo [21]. Administration of endotoxin affects various systemic physiologic and metabolic processes in a manner similar to the early phase of injury and infection, making it a suitable human model for proof-of-principle studies [21]. </p><p id="p0158" num="0158"> Excess release of TNF-a is known to contribute to the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, organ damage and mortality in sepsis [30]. Furthermore, circulating levels of TNF-a and IL-6 are correlated with the severity of sepsis in patients [31]. In line with our animal data [16, 17], the current study demonstrates that enriched nutrition limits inflammation during human experimental endotoxemia by attenuating circulating levels of TNF-a and IL-6. Moreover, the intervention with enriched nutrition resulted in decreased IL-IRA plasma levels. These data are conform previous reports, demonstrating that TNF-a and IL-6 enhance IL-IRA release during endotoxemia, while inhibition of these cytokines lowers circulating IL-IRA [32, 33]. In accordance, attenuation of the inflammatory response using epinephrine or glucocorticoids down- regulates IL-IRA and IL-1 plasma levels [34, 35]. In parallel with these reports, our findings that enriched nutrition not only decreases plasma levels of TNF-a and IL-6 but also of IL-IRA, reflect an overall reduced pro -inflammatory state. Interestingly, postpyloric administration of enriched nutrition amplified the anti-inflammatory response to endotoxin as evidenced by a pronounced increase in circulating IL-10 compared with fasted subjects. IL-10 is considered to be part of the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="26"/>-->
 host-protective mechanism that counterbalances the pro-inflammatory response during acute infection and inflammation [34]. Furthermore, administration of IL-10 has been shown to reduce endotoxin-induced lethality in mice [36]. The beneficial effect of enriched nutrition on the immune response during human endotoxemia is in line with previous studies using well-known pharmacological agents, including epinephrine and glucocorticoids which inhibit plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and augment circulating IL-10 [34, 37]. Together, these data indicate that enriched enteral nutrition is a promising and physiological intervention to control acute inflammation. </p><p id="p0159" num="0159"> Intestinal epithelial cell damage often accompanies sepsis, trauma and major surgery and is related to the degree of gastrointestinal hypoperfusion [38-40]. Additionally, intestinal compromise has been implicated in the development of inflammatory complications following injury [41]. Here, we show that intravenous administration of LPS resulted in increased i-FABP levels. The rise in plasma i-FABP levels tended to be smaller in subjects treated with enriched nutrition compared with control nutrition or fasted subjects, although this did not reach statistical significance. These data are supported by rodents studies demonstrating that lipid-enriched nutrition preserves intestinal integrity [17, 19]. The small increase in i-FABP plasma levels is likely attributable to the relative low dose of LPS and limited hypoperfusion due to the prehydration protocol. Future studies are therefore needed to establish a gut-protective effect of enriched nutrition in man. </p><p id="p0160" num="0160">CCK-mediated activation of vagal afferents plays a dominant role in nutrient- induced digestive, metabolic and immunologic feedback [19, 42, 43]. Intestinal release of CCK is predominantly triggered by the luminal presence of lipid and protein [20, 44], while termination of nutrient exposure results in a rapid drop of CCK levels [44]. Taking these considerations into account, we chose to continuously administer nutrition enriched with lipids and proteins to induce a prolonged stimulation of the CCK-mediated anti-inflammatory pathway. Our nutritional intervention resulted in detectable circulating CCK levels during the entire endotoxin-induced inflammatory response. The fact that bolus administration of a lipid-rich milkshake containing 100 gram fat prior to endotoxin challenge failed to affect the immune response [45], underlines the importance of continuous nutrient administration. In comparison, continuous infusion of enriched nutrition delivered approximately 60 gram fat in total. Although enriched nutrition 
<!-- EPO <DP n="27"/>-->
 displayed a more powerful anti-inflammatory effect than control nutrition, significant differences in CCK levels could not be detected in plasma. This might be explained by the fact that circulating CCK levels do not reflect local intestinal concentrations and subsequent activation of afferent vagal fibres in the gut. In this context, it is interesting that plasma concentrations of exogenous CCK have to be at least 10-fold higher compared with postprandial CCK levels to obtain a similar satiety effect [46]. Future studies using specific CCK-1 receptor antagonists, which are currently not available, should specify the role of local CCK levels. In addition, these studies should also focus on the role of other intestinal peptides, including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Recently, our group implicated GLP-1 as co -stimulatory peptide of the nutritional anti-inflammatory pathway in rodents, since administration of GLP-1 receptor antagonists partially reduced the inhibitory effect of lipid-rich nutrition on systemic inflammation [47]. </p><p id="p0161" num="0161">In conclusion, the current proof-of-principle study demonstrates for the first time that: 1) short- term continuous administration of enteral nutrition immediately modulates inflammation in humans, and 2) enrichment of the nutritional composition with lipid and protein enforces this anti-inflammatory potential. Our findings show that the anti-inflammatory effects of enriched nutrition as previously observed in rodents also apply to the human situation. Taken together, the current study implicates continuous administration of enriched nutrition as a promising intervention to modulate inflammatory conditions in the clinical setting.
