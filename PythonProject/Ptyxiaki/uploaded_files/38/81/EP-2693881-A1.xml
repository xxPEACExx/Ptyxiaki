The signals are conveyed by ligands which bind the extracellular domains of these kinases, thereby activating a signaling pathway. In this superfamily, frequently the ligand is a type of growth factor. One subfamily of kinases within this superfamily are the TAM subfamily of kinases, which comprise the tyrosine receptor kinases Axl, Tyro3 and Mer (Hafizi S and Dahlback B. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">Cytokine Growth Factor Rev 2006; 17: 295-304; Linger RM, et al. Adv Cancer Res 2008; 100: 35-83). This subfamily of kinases have in common a unique extracellular domain with N-terminal immunoglobulin domains and two fibronectin type ΠΙ repeat structures. The structure of the fibronection type ΠΙ repeats bears structural similarity to neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs). Although initially characterized as a single transmembrane protein, Axl can also exist as a soluble protein (sAxl) which is generated by ADAM 10 (a </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">metalloproteinase) mediated proteolysis. The role of sAxl is less well-characterized than intact, transmemberane Axl. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010"> [0003] The natural ligand common to the TAM kinases is Gas6, a product of the growth arrest- specific gene 6 (Hafizi S and Dahlback B. FEBS J 2006; 273:5231-44; Bellido-Martin L and de Frutos PG. Vitam Horm 2008; 78: 185-209.). The protein called protein S is also a potential natural ligand of the TAM kinases. Both of these proteins, Gas6 and protein S, are vitamin K-dependent proteins and share about 43% homology and several distinct protein domains. Binding of Gas6 to Axl leads to Axl autophosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways including MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways (Angelillo- Scherrer A, et al. J Clin Invest 2008; Shankar SL, et al. J Neuorosci 2006, 26: 5638-5648; Keating AK, et al. Oncogene 2006, 25:6092-6100), although the JAK/STAT pathway may be important for TAM-mediated immune responses (Rothlin CV, et al. Cell 2007, 131: 1124- 1136). 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
 [0004] The oncogenic potential of Axl was first discovered in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), but it has been demonstrated to play a role in the progression and metastasis of other cancer types. The increased expression of Axl and/or Axl ligand, Gas6, has been shown in a number of human malignancies, including ovarian, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, uterine leiomyoma, uterine endometrial cancer, thyroid carcinoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer, NSCLC, CML, AML, colorectal carcinoma, prostate cancer, various lymphomas, and esophageal cancer. The biochemical effects of increased expression of Axl is associated with increased oncogenic transformation, cell survival, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and cellular adhesion. Target validation studies of in vivo cancer models show that inhibition of Axl expression by RNAi blocked tumor growth in those models (e.g. see Li, Y. et al. Oncogene 2009, 28:3442-3455). </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> [0005] In addition to the association with cancer and tumorigenesis, TAM family kinases are implicated in a number of other cell and physiological functions. These include regulation of vascular smooth muscle homeostasis (Korshunov VA, et al. Hypertension 2007, 50: 1057-1062; Korshunov VA, et al. Circ Res 2006, 98: 1446-1452), platelet function, thrombus stabilization (Angelillo-Scherrer A, et al. J Clin Invest 2008, 118: 583-596; Gould WR, et al. J Thromb Haemost 2005, 3: 733-741), innate immunity (Lemke G and Rothlin CV. Nat Rev Immunol 2008, 8: 327-336) and inflammation (Rothlin CV, et al. Cell 2007, 131: 1124-1136; Sharif MN, et al. J. Exp Med 2006, 203: 1891-1901). </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">[0006] In summary, the Axl protein appears to have a key role in a number of human disorders, including cancer. The expression of the protein and/or the ligand is altered in these cancer cells. Thus, Axl protein is an attractive and valuable target for the discovery and development of new therapeutic agents to treat cancer and other conditions. There is a need for the design of specific and selective inhibitors for the treatment of disorders mediated and/or associated with Axl kinase. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> SUMMARY </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> [0007] In accordance with the purpose(s) of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the invention, in one aspect, relates to compounds useful as inhibitors of the PDK/Akt pathway, compounds useful as inhibitors of Axl, methods of making same, pharmaceutical compositions comprising same, and methods of treating disorders of uncontrolled cellular proliferation using same. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> [0008] Disclosed are compounds having a structure represented by a formula:

The term does not denote a particular age or sex. Thus, adult and newborn subjects, as well as fetuses, whether male or female, are intended to be covered. In one aspect, the subject is a mammal. A patient refers to a subject afflicted with a disease or disorder. The term "patient" includes human and veterinary subjects. In some aspects of the disclosed methods, the subject has been diagnosed with a need for treatment of a disorder of uncontrolled cellular proliferation associated with a protein kinase dysfunction prior to the administering step. In some aspects of the disclosed method, the subject has been diagnosed with a need for inhibition of a protein kinase prior to the administering step. </p><p id="p0110" num="0110">[0053] As used herein, the term "treatment" refers to the medical management of a patient with the intent to cure, ameliorate, stabilize, or prevent a disease, pathological condition, or disorder. This term includes active treatment, that is, treatment directed specifically toward the improvement of a disease, pathological condition, or disorder, and also includes causal treatment, that is, treatment directed toward removal of the cause of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder. In addition, this term includes palliative treatment, that is, treatment designed for the relief of symptoms rather than the curing of the disease, pathological condition, or disorder; preventative treatment, that is, treatment directed to minimizing or partially or completely inhibiting the development of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder; and supportive treatment, that is, treatment employed to supplement another specific therapy directed toward the improvement of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder; and supportive treatment, that is, treatment employed to supplement another specific therapy directed toward the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="20"/>-->
 improvement of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder. In various aspects, the term covers any treatment of a subject, including a mammal (e.g., a human), and includes: (i) preventing the disease from occurring in a subject that can be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (ii) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting its development; or (iii) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease. In one aspect, the subject is a mammal such as a primate, and, in a further aspect, the subject is a human. The term "subject" also includes domesticated animals (e.g., cats, dogs, etc.), livestock (e.g., cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, etc.), and laboratory animals (e.g., mouse, rabbit, rat, guinea pig, fruit fly, etc.). </p><p id="p0111" num="0111"> [0054] As used herein, the term "prevent" or "preventing" refers to precluding, averting, obviating, forestalling, stopping, or hindering something from happening, especially by advance action. It is understood that where reduce, inhibit or prevent are used herein, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the use of the other two words is also expressly disclosed. </p><p id="p0112" num="0112">[0055] As used herein, the term "diagnosed" means having been subjected to a physical examination by a person of skill, for example, a physician, and found to have a condition that can be diagnosed or treated by the compounds, compositions, or methods disclosed herein. For example, "diagnosed with a disorder of uncontrolled cellular proliferation" means having been subjected to a physical examination by a person of skill, for example, a physician, and found to have a condition that can be diagnosed or treated by a compound or composition that can inhibit a protein kinase. As a further example, "diagnosed with a need for inhibition of a protein kinase" refers to having been subjected to a physical examination by a person of skill, for example, a physician, and found to have a condition characterized by a protein kinase dysfunction. Such a diagnosis can be in reference to a disorder, such as a disorder of uncontrolled cellular proliferation, cancer and the like, as discussed herein. For example, the term "diagnosed with a need for inhibition of protein kinase activity" refers to having been subjected to a physical examination by a person of skill, for example, a physician, and found to have a condition that can be diagnosed or treated by inhibition of protein kinase activity. For example, "diagnosed with a need for treatment of one or more disorders of uncontrolled cellular proliferation associated with a protein kinase dysfunction" means having been subjected to a physical examination by a person of skill, for example, a physician, and found to have one or more disorders of uncontrolled cellular proliferation associated with a protein kinase dysfunction. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="21"/>-->
 [0056] As used herein, the phrase "identified to be in need of treatment for a disorder," or the like, refers to selection of a subject based upon need for treatment of the disorder. For example, a subject can be identified as having a need for treatment of a disorder (e.g., a disorder related to a dysfunction of protein kinase activity) based upon an earlier diagnosis by a person of skill and thereafter subjected to treatment for the disorder. It is contemplated that the identification can, in one aspect, be performed by a person different from the person making the diagnosis. It is also contemplated, in a further aspect, that the administration can be performed by one who subsequently performed the administration. </p><p id="p0113" num="0113">[0057] As used herein, the terms "administering" and "administration" refer to any method of providing a pharmaceutical preparation to a subject. Such methods are well known to those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to, oral administration, transdermal administration, administration by inhalation, nasal administration, topical administration, intravaginal administration, ophthalmic administration, intraaural administration, </p><p id="p0114" num="0114">intracerebral administration, rectal administration, sublingual administration, buccal administration, and parenteral administration, including injectable such as intravenous administration, intra- arterial administration, intramuscular administration, and subcutaneous administration. Administration can be continuous or intermittent. In various aspects, a preparation can be administered therapeutically; that is, administered to treat an existing disease or condition. In further various aspects, a preparation can be administered </p><p id="p0115" num="0115">prophylactically; that is, administered for prevention of a disease or condition. </p><p id="p0116" num="0116">[0058] The term "contacting" as used herein refers to bringing a disclosed compound and a cell, target protein kinase, or other biological entity together in such a manner that the compound can affect the activity of the target (e.g., spliceosome, cell, etc.), either directly; i.e., by interacting with the target itself, or indirectly; i.e., by interacting with another molecule, co-factor, factor, or protein on which the activity of the target is dependent. </p><p id="p0117" num="0117">[0059] As used herein, the terms "effective amount" and "amount effective" refer to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired result or to have an effect on an undesired condition. For example, a "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic result or to have an effect on undesired symptoms, but is generally insufficient to cause adverse side affects. The specific </p><p id="p0118" num="0118">therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="22"/>-->
 time of administration; the route of administration; the rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of a compound at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration. Consequently, single dose compositions can contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any contraindications. Dosage can vary, and can be administered in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or several days. Guidance can be found in the literature for appropriate dosages for given classes of pharmaceutical products. In further various aspects, a preparation can be administered in a "prophylactically effective amount"; that is, an amount effective for prevention of a disease or condition. </p><p id="p0119" num="0119"> [0060] As used herein, "kit" means a collection of at least two components constituting the kit.

Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like), carboxymethylcellulose and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents such as paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid and the like. It can also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin, which delay absorption. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide, poly(orthoesters) and poly( anhydrides). Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable media just prior to use. Suitable inert carriers can include sugars such as lactose.

Organic radicals often have hydrogen bound to at least some of the carbon atoms of the organic radical. One example, of an organic radical that comprises no inorganic atoms is a 5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydro-2- naphthyl radical. In some embodiments, an organic radical can contain 1-10 inorganic heteroatoms bound thereto or therein, including halogens, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, and the like.

Examples of inorganic radicals include, but not limited to, amino, hydroxy, halogens, nitro, thiol, sulfate, phosphate, and like commonly known inorganic radicals. The inorganic radicals do not have bonded therein the metallic elements of the periodic table (such as the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals, lanthanide metals, or actinide metals), although such metal ions can sometimes serve as a pharmaceutically acceptable cation for anionic inorganic radicals such as a sulfate, phosphate, or like anionic inorganic radical.

In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound. For example, a compound prefixed with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory or a compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these compounds, called stereoisomers, are identical except that they are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer can also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture. Many of the compounds described herein can have one or more chiral centers and therefore can exist in different enantiomeric forms. If desired, a chiral carbon can be designated with an asterisk (*). When bonds to the chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the disclosed formulas, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of the chiral carbon, and hence both enantiomers and mixtures thereof, are embraced within the formula. As is used in the art, when it is desired to specify the absolute configuration about a chiral carbon, one of the bonds to the chiral carbon can be depicted as a wedge (bonds to atoms above the plane) and the other can be depicted as a series or wedge of short parallel lines is (bonds to atoms below the plane). The Cahn-Inglod-Prelog system can be used to assign the (R) or (S) configuration to a chiral carbon.

 [00130] Compounds described herein comprise atoms in both their natural isotopic abundance and in non-natural abundance. The disclosed compounds can be isotopically- labelled or isotopically-substituted compounds identical to those described, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2 H, 3 H, 13 C, <sup>14</sup> C, <sup>15</sup> N, <sup>18</sup> O, <sup>17</sup> 0, <sup>35</sup> S, <sup>18</sup> F and <sup>36</sup> CI, respectively. Compounds further comprise prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as <sup>3</sup> H and <sup>14</sup> C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., H, and carbon- 14, i.e., <sup>14</sup> C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of the present invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labelled reagent for a non- isotopically labelled reagent. </p><p id="p0213" num="0213">[00131] The compounds described in the invention can be present as a solvate.

 [00261] In one synthetic approach to improved Axl inhibitors, anilines bearing heterocycles with desirable pharmacokinetic properties were installed in the 2-position and electron-deficient aryl groups were attached in the R<sup>d</sup> position. The compounds synthesized in this series resulted in compounds with activities in the 10 μΜ range.

METHODS OF USING THE COMPOUNDS AND COMPOSITIONS </p><p id="p0671" num="0671"> [00344] The TAM receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily comprises Axl (also known as UFO, ARK, and Tyro7; nucleotide accession numbers NM_021913 and NM_001699; protein accession numbers NP_068713 and NP_001690), Mer (Stk, Nyk) and Tyro3 (Rse/Dtk/Sky). The TAM receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily is characterised by a common protein domain structure comprising a C-terminal extracellular ligand-binding domain and N-terminal cytoplasmic region containing the catalytic domain.. The members all possess the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="158"/>-->
 combination of two extracellular N-terminal immunoglobulin type domains and two fibronectin ΙΠ domains, a single span transmembrane region followed by C-terminal kinase domain (e.g. see Hafizi, S., et al., Cytokine Growth Factor Rev ., 2006, 17:295-304). All members of this kinase subfamily bind and are stimulated to varying degrees by the same ligand, Gas6 (growth arrest specific-6), an approximately 76 kDa secreted protein with significant homology to the coagulation cascade regulator, Protein S. </p><p id="p0672" num="0672">[00345] Gas6 acts as a ligand to all of the TAM receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily, but exhibits differing affinities for the receptors and activates the three proteins to varying degrees. Gas6 is a member of the vitamin K-dependent family of proteins and shows a 43% sequence identity and the same domain organisation to protein S, a serum protein which has been shown to be a negative regulator of blood coagulation (e.g. see Hafizi, S., et al., FEBS J., 2006, 273: 5231-5244). Gas6 is upregulated in growth arrested cells (e.g. see Manfioletti, G., Mol. Cell. Biol., 1993, 13: 4976-4985) which indicates a function in protection of the cell against cellular stresses. It has since been shown that Gas6 can cross link Axl monomers and promote cellular survival, proliferation and migration (e.g. see Bellosta, P., et al., Oncogene, 1997, 15:2387-2397; Sainaghi, P. P., et al., 2005, J. Cell Physiol., 2005, 204:36-44; Fridell, Y. W., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1998, 273:7123-7126). </p><p id="p0673" num="0673"> [00346] In addition to binding to ligands, the Axl extracellular domain has been shown to undergo homophilic interactions that mediate cell aggregation, suggesting that one important function of Axl may be to mediate cell-cell adhesion. This homophilic binding of the Axl extracellular domain can result in cellular aggregation and this event is independent of the intracellular kinase activity (e.g. see Bellosta, P., et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 1995, 15:614-625.). </p><p id="p0674" num="0674">[00347] The Axl intracellular kinase domain (ICD) is responsible for the oncogenic transforming ability of Axl RTK. The Gas6/ Axl signal trangduction pathway operates, although not exclusively, through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K) pathway (e.g. see Shankar, S. L., et al., J. Neurosci., 2006, 26:5638-5648.). The PDK/Akt signaling network is crucial to widely divergent physiological processes that include cell cycle progression, differentiation, transcription, translation and apoptosis (e.g. see Hanada, M., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 2004, 1697:3-16.). Activation of PDK/Akt signaling results in disturbance of control of cell proliferation and apoptosis, ensuing in competitive growth advantage for tumor cells. Activation of Akt is associated with phosphorylation of Ser 473 (e.g. see Alessi, D. R., EMBO J., 1996, 15:6541-6551) and monitoring changes in levels of total and phosphorylated Akt within the cell enables an assessment of the efficacy of drugs 
<!-- EPO <DP n="159"/>-->
 which act upstream of Akt. The intracellular domain of Axl kinase has been shown to associate with many proteins, e.g. p55gamma, p85alpha and beta subunits of PI3K, phospholipaseC-gamma, Grb2, c-Src, Lck, SOCS-1, Nck2, RanBMP, CI -TEN and Axl ICD itself (Hafizi, S., et al., Cytokine Growth Factor Rev ., 2006, 17:295-304; Hafizi, S., et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 2002. 299:793-800; Braunger, J., et al., Oncogene, 1997, 14:2619-2631). </p><p id="p0675" num="0675"> [00348] Axl is predominantly expressed in the vasculature in both endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and in cells of the myeloid lineage and is also detected in breast epithelial cells, chondrocytes, Sertoli cells and neurons. Axl is ubiquitously expressed at low levels and is detectable in a variety of organs (e.g. see Rescigno, J., et al., Oncogene, 1991, 6: 1909-1913). Expression patterns of the other two family members (Mer and Tyro3) differ from that of Axl. Expression of Tyro3 is predominantly in the brain and the CNS (e.g. see Mark, M. R., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1994, 269: 10720-10728), and expression of Mer is almost exclusively in the monocyte cell lineage (Graham, D. K., et al., Cell Growth Differ., 1994, 5: 647-657). Several functions are attributed to Axl signaling in cell culture, including, but not limited to, protection from apoptosis induced by serum starvation, TNF-a or the viral protein E1A, as well as migration and cell differentiation. However, Axl-/- mice exhibit no overt developmental phenotype and the physiological function of Axl in vivo is not clearly established in the literature. </p><p id="p0676" num="0676"> [00349] The overexpression of Axl and/or its ligand has also been reported in a wide variety of solid tumor types including, but not limited to, breast, renal, endometrial, ovarian, thyroid, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and uveal melanoma as well as in myeloid leukemias. Furthermore, it possesses transforming activity in NIH3T3 and 32D cells. It has been demonstrated that loss of Axl expression in tumor cells blocks the growth of solid human neoplasms in an in vivo MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma xenograft model. Overexpression of Axl has been demonstrated in numerous cancer cell lines, e.g., colon, gastric, breast, lung, AML, thyroid, ocular, prostate, ocular melanoma, ovarian, renal, and SCC (e.g. see Sainaghi, P. P., et al., J. Cell Physiol., 2005, 204:36-44; Sawaby, T., et al., Mol. Carcinog., 2007, 46: 155-164; Vajkoczy, P., et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 2006, 103:5799-5804; Shieh, Y. S., et al., Neoplasia, 2005, 7: 1058-1064). This expression has been linked to the development of an oncogenic cellular phenotype (e.g. see Shieh, Y. S., et al., Neoplasia, 2005, 7: 1058- 1064). Overexpression of Axl has been linked to stage of disease and prognosis (Sawaby, T., et al., Mol. Carcinog., 2007, 46: 155-164; Vajkoczy, P., et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA,

Taken together, these data suggest Axl signaling can independently regulate angiogenesis and tumor growth and thus represents a novel target class for tumor therapeutic development </p><p id="p0677" num="0677">[00350] Angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) is limited to functions such as wound healing and the female reproductive cycle in healthy adults.
