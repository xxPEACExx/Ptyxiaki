In particular, the center being soft while the outer layer is crispy or crunchy. The centre is preferably a fruit-based centre. </p><p id="p0003" num="0003">It is difficult to maintain a texture contrast in a snack product during shelf life (generally 1 to 18 months, preferably 2 to 12, preferably 4 to 9 ideally 6 to 9 months), especially in a non frozen product, without compromising nutrition (by adding too much fat for instance). In order for the centre of a food product, such as a fruit ingredient, to remain soft it must be moist. However, the water in the soft center tends to migrate from the center. If the centre were to be provided with a crispy layer this would then lose its crispiness: cereals become soft when too humid. US 4 961 943 discloses coating dried fruits by applying a coating of melted fat or oil on which dry cereal particulates are dusted. The coating inhibits the migration of moisture from the fruit core to the cereal component therefore avoiding the loss of crispiness of the cereal layer. The dry coating contains particulates having a particle size of about 1/32 to 1/16 inch in length i.e. 0.79 to 1.59 mm. The fruit used can be any dried and/or candied fruits pieces having a moisture level of about 12-18%. This moisture level corresponds to an Aw of the around 0.5 to 0.65. Such whole fruit pieces could be hard to chew and would not be considered as soft. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004">US 4 961 943 uses fat as a water barrier, because the fat component of the coating resists the migration of moisture from the fruit, and specific cereals (shredded cereals or germs) or nuts to be more resistant to moisture. In addition, because the centre used in this document is a piece of fruit, the size and shape of the centre described in this document is also difficult to change. Furthermore, because of the coating which consists mainly of fat, the nutritional value is compromised with too much fat. Moreover, the fat layer, even if it is a good water barrier is not a good glue to stick the cereal pieces on the product. Therefore only small pieces can be used. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">US 4 961 943 also indicates that it is difficult to keep the water barrier continuous if there is only one layer. That's why this document suggests the use of multiple fat layers which 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
 increases again the fat content of the product thus obtained. It has also been found that the fat layer can crack or break after production during packaging or, distribution due to mechanical shocks, thus losing its water barrier function. CA 2 034 642 describes how to obtain a soft fruit-based product while maintaining crispiness of cereal flakes which are combined with it. A gelling agent must be added in the fruit-based product. Therefore, the product needs to be hot shaped, at a temperature of between 60 and 100Ό. Such high temperature can alt er the flavor and color of a fruit- based product and in particular give a cooked taste, especially for red fruits. Therefore the product obtained does not have the natural taste and color of fruit. Furthermore this document does not indicate how to obtain a fruit-based product fully enrobed by the cereal. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">FR 2 922 414 concerns a food product consisting in a cereal product containing a date filling, the cereal product keeping its crispiness. However the cereal product is not formed of individual crunchy pieces but in a continuous biscuit which is obtained by hot co- extrusion. The filling must also be fluid enough to be pumpable. Because of the necessary co-extrusion step and of the pumpability of the filling, it is therefore not possible to confer a particular form to the filling such as a 3D solid of revolution form. Moreover, because of the co-extrusion step using high temperature, red fruit could not be used instead of date since the flavor and color of this type of fruits would be altered. </p><p id="p0007" num="0007">US 4 256 772 describes how to prevent the migration of moisture from a soft fruit-based product to dry crisps cereals by using humectants in order to keep low Aw. However the fruits are not totally enrobed by the crispy cereal. Furthermore the fruits do not have a shapeable consistency such as that of typical modeling clay. It is, therefore, not possible to provide a particular form to the fruits, such as 3D solid of revolution form. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">WO 03/059084 discloses a multilayer product. Here at least one of the layers is provided as a barrier to prevent fat migration and bloom of the chocolate coating. It does not disclose a suitable coating for use as an adhesive for a further crispy coating material. </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">It is also known to make superficially similar products in home baking. However, such recipes are not suitable for mass-production and do not contemplate the requirements for

 reproducible shaping or long term storage. Moreover, the strict fat content requirements or levels of Aw are not a concern in home baking. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">There is a desire for bite-size food products in which the outside can look like a cereal product and which presents a texture contrast: the center, in particular the fruit-based center, being soft while the outer layer is crispy or crunchy. Furthermore it is desirable for the texture contrast to be maintainable during a prolonged shelf life (generally 1 to 18 months, preferably 2 to 12, preferably 4 to 9 ideally 6 to 9 months at 0 to 30Ό, preferably 10 to 25Ό), without compromising nutrition (by add ing too much fat for instance). </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">Moreover, in the case of a fruit-based center the taste will desirably stay as natural as possible without any "cooked taste", whatever the fruit used. Furthermore, the center should be a malleable to provide easy and convenient shaping into any desired form, such as a ball form, without the need to heat the product at a temperature above 60Χ. Accordingly, the present disclosure seeks to address at least some of the problems associated with the prior art, or at least provide a commercially useful alternative thereto. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Accordingly, in a first aspect the present disclosure provides a bite-size food product comprising: </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> a) a plastic solid soft centre, </p><p id="p0014" num="0014"> b) a layer of a chocolate or chocolate-like composition coating the centre, c) a layer of individual crispy pieces fully covering the chocolate or chocolate-like composition layer, </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> the food product having a fat content of between 4 and 24% by weight based on the total weight of the food product, </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> the soft centre having an Aw of between 0.28 and 0.6, a fat content of less than 14% by weight based on the total weight of the centre, and forming 40-76% by weight of the food product.

In particular, the selection of the specific active water values and fat content of the soft centre allow for the formation of a coatable centre that can be provided with a moisture sensitive outer coating. In particular, the product can be made to appear as a biscuit product, whilst having a soft centre, without having an undesirably short shelf-life. Moreover, the product can be mass-produced on an industrial scale due to the excellent processability of the ingredient mix used to form the centre. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019">A bite-sized food product is a food product suitably sized to be eaten in one or two bites by an adult.

The food product has a plastic solid soft fruit-based centre. These terms are well known in the art. A plastic solid is a material that is capable of being shaped or formed. In contrast, an elastic solid would not retain its shaped form and nor would a fluid centre. Soft centred foods are known in the art and confectionary is often marketed as soft-centred. Soft centred foods have advantageous organo-leptic properties and allow the product to reflect the texture properties of the natural fruit. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022">Preferably, the centre has the consistency at room temperature similar to that of a typical modelling clay. That is, like modelling clay, it is possible to change the form of the centre by simply applying a hand-pressure, without the necessity to heat the product. Furthermore, 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
 like modelling clay, if no pressure is applied, the centre retains its shape and therefore does not flow. The centre is therefore malleable, deformable and can be hand-molded. It has the workability of modeling clay and it is not too sticky or gummy to form and handle. However, contrary to modeling clay, the centre can contain discernable fruit pieces and, therefore, need not have only a fine texture. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023">The bite-size product has a fat content of between 4 and 24% by weight based on the total weight of the food product.

The Aw of the centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure is very important: if the Aw is above 0.6, the centre a) is softer and more juicy, but the cereal layer c) losses rapidly its crispiness. If the Aw is lower than 0.28, the centre is generally too hard to chew or too sticky if a high amount of humectant is used. Typical corresponding water content is 4 to 17% by weight based on the total weight of the centre, usually 6 to 17%, preferably 7 to 15% by weight, more preferably 8 to 13% by weight.

These would be either too liquid or too sticky and a jam does not have the natural taste of fruit. Moreover, a jam introduces a cooked flavour in the final product. </p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The fruit-based centre according to the present disclosure does not consist of a single entire piece of classical dried fruits such as raisin, apricot or plum. This is because such pieces may be too small and when the Aw of a whole fruit piece is &lt; 0.55 to 0.6, they are too hard to chew and not juicy.

<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
 The fruit-based centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure is not gelled by hot depositing like in "gelled fruit paste" ("pate de fruits" in French) or by any other process. In some embodiments it may contain some gelled part, preferably less than 25wt% of the fruit centre.

In another embodiment, the centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure is fudge-based. Fudge has a caramelized taste, but its texture differs from a toffee by being short and much less sticky. Its composition is a mix of sucrose (usually the main sugar), at least one reducing sugar (for instance glucose and/or fructose, or syrup containing them like glucose-fructose syrup or invert sugar; and/or lactose), and at least one source of protein, normally milk protein, generally cow milk. Optional components can comprise emulsifiers, salt &amp; aromas, acids, bases or buffer salt to manipulate pH, humectants (sorbitol, glycerol, other polyols), fats (for instance milk fat sources, palm oil). Sugars are the main ingredient category. The reducing sugar(s) can come only from the "in process" sucrose inversion or only from the milk. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040">The process for preparing a fudge usually comprises 2 important steps: </p><p id="p0041" num="0041"> • the heating of the mix to reduce the final water content and create the Maillard reaction, </p><p id="p0042" num="0042"> • then the sucrose crystallisation step during cooling, where we try to get small crystal (target 20-35μιη) to avoid sandiness on tasting </p><p id="p0043" num="0043"> Its typical water content can be from 4 to 10%, often 5 to 9%. A large part of the sucrose is crystallised. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044">As it is well known by the one skilled in the art, a fudge example is made by mixing sugar, butter, and milk and heating it to 1 16 Ό, and then beating the mixture while it cools so that it acquires a smooth, creamy consistency. The sugar used is mainly saccharose to promote recrystallisation. The fudge can be flavored with caramel and/or cocoa, advantageously with caramel.

 Advantageously, the centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure is not toffee-based. </p><p id="p0045" num="0045">In a particular embodiment of the present disclosure, the fruit-based centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure contains up to 28% by weight of humectant based on the total weight of the fruit-based centre. The use of humectants helps to ensure that the centre remains chewable and has a pleasant mouthfeel, even when used with a low Aw product. The centre preferably contains up to 20% by weight of humectant based on the total weight of the fruit-based centre, advantageously between 4 and 28% by weight of humectants, more advantageously between 4 and 20% by weight of humectants, still more advantageously between 4 and 16% by weight of humectants. </p><p id="p0046" num="0046">The humectant preferably comprises one or more polyols, advantageously chosen in the group consisting of propylene glycol, monosaccharide polyols like glycerol, erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol and mannitol, disaccharide polyols like maltitol and lactitol, and mixture thereof, more advantageously one or more monosaccharide polyols, in particular glycerol, sorbitol or mixture thereof, still more advantageously glycerol. </p><p id="p0047" num="0047">Where polyols are used as humectant it is advantageous that their amount is not too high. This is because of the potential laxative effects of polyols where the final bite-size food product contains 10% by weight or more of polyols based on the total weight of the food product. </p><p id="p0048" num="0048">In another particular embodiment of the present disclosure, the centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure is not gelled.

In particular it does not contain any gelatinized starch. </p><p id="p0049" num="0049">The fruit-based centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure is not gelled. More advantageously it does not contain any gelatine or any gelatinized starch.

 The fruit-based centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure can contain some bulking agent, such as, for example, non-gelatinized starch, maltodextrin, fibres like poly-dextrose or mixture thereof, advantageously in the amount of up to 40% by weight based on the total weight of the fruit-based centre, more advantageously between 15 and 27% by weight. In particular the fruit-based centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure contains non-gelatinized starch, preferably non- gelatinized native starch. </p><p id="p0050" num="0050">Unlike maltodextrins, non-gelatinized native starch absorbs very little saliva in the mouth and therefore does not increase the stickiness of the centre. Furthermore, as native starch is a non-modified natural product, it is not part of food additives, which have to be reported as such on the package of the marketed product. </p><p id="p0051" num="0051">In addition, native starch does not have any digestive drawbacks, unlike most polyols which have a strong laxative effect. The fact that it is not cooked makes natural starch slowly digestible, which allows a reduction of the glycemic index of the food product according to the present disclosure. Thus, addition of non-gelatinized native starch in the centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure causes as an additional effect a sensation of satiety which is extended relatively to products containing simple sugars. </p><p id="p0052" num="0052">The grain size of granules of native starches, which is generally comprised between 2 μιη and 100 μιη, and more generally between 5 μιη and 45 μιη, is also ideal for a use in the centre of the food product according to the disclosure. Thus, native starches neither comprise too many fine particles nor too many large particles, except maybe potato which has coarser granules up to 100 μιη. The balance between small size and large size granules may, if needed, be adjusted according to the sought textures and properties, by mixing in different proportions, starches from various origins. </p><p id="p0053" num="0053">In an advantageous embodiment, the particle size (mean longest diameter) of the starch is for at least 90% of the particles, comprised between 2μιη and 100 μιη, preferably between 5 μιη and 45 μιη. Among native starches, wheat starch is preferred, because it has an ideal grain size from 2 μιη to 45 μιη, and because it is a natural constituent in cereal baked products, which are mainly based on wheat flour, moreover often mixed with wheat starch. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="14"/>-->
 Maize and manioc starches are also part of the preferred starches because of their grain size. </p><p id="p0054" num="0054">Other advantages of native starch are its neutral flavor and its white color, which allows the fruit-based centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure to assume the taste and the color of the fruit in case of fruit-based centre. Finally, native starch is an inexpensive ingredient. It may normally be used without any grinding in the centre according to the disclosure, which allows a simplified making process and larger productivity. </p><p id="p0055" num="0055">The centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure can contain some added sugars, i.e. in the case of fruit-based centre, sugars which are not initially present in the fruit material. By "sugar or sugars", is intended to mean in the sense of the present disclosure the dry matter of any mono- and disaccharides, whatever the source and also by extension all the dry matter of the glucose syrup, also called glucose-fructose syrup or fructose-glucose syrup. Among monosaccharides mention may be made of fructose, galactose, glucose, mannose and mixture thereof. Among disaccharides, mention may notably be made of saccharose, but saccharose may be partly or totally replaced with another disaccharide such as lactose or maltose. Glucose syrup contains mono and disaccharides, but also some longer chains of polymerized dextrose. Advantageously in the case of fruit based centre added sugars are mainly monosaccharides. Advantageously the amount of added sugar in the fruit-based centre is up to 50% by weight based on the total weight of the centre, more advantageously up to 33% by weight, still more advantageously up to 25% by weight, even still more advantageously up to 15% by weight on the dry matter basis. </p><p id="p0056" num="0056">The centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure can contain one or more food acid, in particular citric or malic acid or mixture thereof, advantageously in an amount of up to 5% by weight based on the total weight of the centre, more </p><p id="p0057" num="0057">advantageously of between 0.3 and 1 % by weight. The acid can enhance the flavour of the centre, in particular in the case of a fruit-based centre.

 In an advantageous embodiment of the present disclosure, no colorant additives, preservatives additives and artificial aroma is present in the centre of the bite-size food product. </p><p id="p0058" num="0058">The centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure can also contain some crispy pieces. By crispy it is meant a piece or fragment that gives a crunchy or brittle texture when eaten. Preferred crispy pieces include cereal inclusions. These crispy pieces are not taking into account for calculating the fat content and/or the fruit solid content of the centre, but are taking into account for the calculation of the centre weight relative to the other layers. </p><p id="p0059" num="0059">In an advantageous embodiment of the present disclosure, the fruit-based centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure is cold formed at a temperature of less than 60Χ, preferably less than 50Χ, more preferably 0-50Ό, more advantageously 0-40Χ, still more advantageously 4-35Ό and in par ticular at 20±1 OX. Preferably the fruit components used in the centre are at no point subjected to temperatures in excess of 60Ό. This prevents the development of cooked flavo urs in the fruit. "Cold forming" refers to the shaping of the ingredients to give a particular shape to the fruit- based centre at a temperature of below 60Χ. The in ventors have found that below this temperature, the natural pectin present in a fruit-based centre is not functionalized. </p><p id="p0060" num="0060">Therefore the product does not set in the final shape of the product. Therefore there is no jellification during the forming of the fruit-based centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure. It is possible to cold-formed the centre because it has a modelling clay like consistency. </p><p id="p0061" num="0061">Due to the fact that the centre of the bite-size food product according to the present disclosure can be cold formed, it can have any shape possible.

In the sense of the present disclosure, by "chocolate" is meant any such concentrated suspension of solid particles in a continuous fatty phase, which is not a water-in-oil emulsion, and which fat is solid at 20 to 25 . Traces of water content, up to 3% in weight of the chocolate, like in tropicalised chocolate, are not considered as water in oil emulsion. Chocolate is solid or semi-solid at shelf life </p><p id="p0066" num="0066">temperature, and usually liquid at 45 .

The chocolates may have a very crispy texture at 20Ό (for example if they only contain cocoa butter) or a rather soft texture (for example if they contain a larger proportion of AMF or especially hazelnut oil). In the sense of the present disclosure, by "chocolate-analog" is meant any concentrated suspension answering the above general chocolate definition, but which does not meet the legal definition of chocolate. The chocolate-analog composition may indeed contain ingredients which, according to the 2000/36/EC Community Directive, are not authorized in a chocolate, such as for example starch or certain vegetable fats. This may for example be

 a hydrogenated optionally fractionated lauric fatty material. The analog may also contain ingredients authorized in chocolate, but at doses which are not accepted for chocolate (for example more than 5% of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter). These analogs of chocolate are generally called in French "pate a glacer" and in English "chocolate compound or "compound". This gives it a texture close to chocolates, but sometime a bit softer. </p><p id="p0067" num="0067">The chocolate or chocolate-like composition can be sweet (in that case, the main powder is usually sugars, preferably sucrose), or savoury (may contain vegetables powders, cereals, spices and herbs).

When working on an industrial scale it will be appreciated that a machine equivalent to a meat grinder will be used. A meat grinder is well known by the one skilled in the art. The ingredients are put into a funnel, which is placed on the top of the grinder. From there the material goes on a horizontal screw conveyor. This screw conveyor, which can be powered by a hand wheel or an electric motor, squashes and partially mixes the ingredients. At the end of the screw conveyor there is a knife installed directly in front of the fixed plate with holes. At this opening the minced ingredients comes out of the machine.

Typical water content is from 8 to 16% (for sugar infused) and up to 26% (apple sun dried), and Aw 0.55 to - more common- 0.65 or 0.70 (and even more in presence of sulphites, which is an antioxidant having some antimicrobial effect), which is too high to use in combination with crunchy ingredients. </p><p id="p0123" num="0123">Semi-dried fruits used are preferred in pieces rather than in paste, to decrease stickiness during process, get a more modeling texture and to have a more natural aspect and texture. </p><p id="p0124" num="0124">The best suitable semi-dried fruits are sun dried raisin (dark or golden), apricot, apple, figs. Other suitable semi-dried fruits are peach, pear, plum, dates, banana and mango. Among dried and sugar infused fruit, the cranberries, as sold in "raisin-like" form are preferred. Preferred fruits regarding texture are cranberry, raisin (golden or black), apricot, which can all be used alone or in mixes. Apples are often more dry, less cohesive and are better to be used in blend with the previous fruits. Cranberries are very useful as their bitterness and astringency hide any too sweet taste and their color is beautiful. </p><p id="p0125" num="0125">Tomato, red bell pepper and pumpkin can also be used. </p><p id="p0126" num="0126">However, other fruit sources (fruit paste made from grinding of dried or semi-dried fruits, concentrated fruit puree made from whole fruit by evaporation under vacuum heating, concentrated juices usually made after removal of at least part of the particles in suspension containing fibers, or fruit powders) could be used, preferably as a complement to dried or infused fruits, but also as the main fruit source. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="25"/>-->
 Citrus like are less suitable as main fruit solid source, because of their low solid / fiber content and their high acidity. They will be rather used in concentrated juice and / or puree form, as a complement. Possible fruit powders are apple, strawberry, and raspberry. They can be obtained by several methods, for instance oven dried and milling or freeze dried and milling, or spray dried juice. Fruit powder will preferably count &lt; 15% by weight of the centre weight, preferably &lt; 10% by weight and more preferably &lt; 5% by weight. Possible fruit concentrates are raspberry, strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, blackcurrant, orange, pineapple and citrus. Fruit concentrates will preferably count &lt;10% by weight of the centre weight, preferably 2 to 6% by weight. </p><p id="p0127" num="0127">No added gelling or setting hydrocolloid (pectin, starch, gums, alginates for example) is necessary to make the texture and the forming.

<!-- EPO <DP n="26"/>-->
 The mixing and mincing of the ingredients can therefore be carried out at the same time or successively. Advantageously the mincing, in particular with a meat grinder, of step 1 ) is carried out before and after the mixing. In a particular embodiment, a first cutting can be made by the fruit supplier: it consist to reduce the size of the whole fruit (which can be big: apricot, apple for example) in pieces of mean size below the diameter of the fruit-based centre, and preferably below half of this size. Then the fruits pieces obtained are mixed with other ingredients, and the second mincing enable to finish the size reduction, while releasing some sugars to improve the internal cohesion of the centre during following forming. </p><p id="p0136" num="0136">The mincing step reduces the fruit pieces to fit the final center size. More importantly, it also gives a less hard / chewy / leathery texture to the mixture obtained and therefore the consistency of modeling clay. It also helps to have a good balance between the internal cohesion (necessary for the forming and solidity after forming) and external stickiness, which may disturb the forming. </p><p id="p0137" num="0137">Mincing may be an important step: if the fruit pieces are bought already chopped with the right granulometry directly from the supplier, it may not be possible to just form them (without further mincing), as the product obtained will not be cohesive enough. This is due to the fact that the supplier usually adds a small % of anti-caking agents (oil, starch, sugars for example). Mincing exudes some sticky liquid sugars and disperses the anti-caking agents, which enables the internal cohesion. However, if the mincing is too much, external stickiness can occurs and give problems for the later forming. </p><p id="p0138" num="0138">Any conventional mixer can be used for mixing the ingredients, for instance planetary, or with 1 or preferably 2 horizontal shafts like Z-Arm mixer. </p><p id="p0139" num="0139">Advantageously, it is simpler to start from partly hot infused dried fruits at an Aw below 0.6. An example is cranberries, which can not be found without added sugars in such food form. Commercial dried cranberries are infused by at least sugars, and often also with glycerol (to make them softer) and eventually other soluble components, and can have an Aw for instance from 0.45 to 0.53. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="27"/>-->
 They can be processed with a single meat grinder which kneads, minces and extrudes a cylinder, like for making sausages. </p><p id="p0140" num="0140">To have a softer texture, it is possible to pass the product 2 times in the grinder: first time without the "sausage" extruding exit, to just mince / knead the fruits, and the second time with the sausage extruding exit to further mince and form the cylinder at the same time. </p><p id="p0141" num="0141">Therefore in a particular embodiment of the process according to the present disclosure, the mincing of the ingredients and in particular of the fruit part in case of a fruit-based center of step 1 a) is carried out at least once, and advantageously at least twice. </p><p id="p0142" num="0142"> The second sub-step 1 b) necessary for preparing the centre of the bite-size product according to the present disclosure consists in cold forming the product obtained in step 1 a) at a temperature below 60Ό. The preferred shape is a solid of revolution, preferably a ball (= quite round product). This ball shape can be obtained from a "boilies table": this is a forming device well known to make round carp fishing baits called "boilies", made of a dough containing a cereal flour and eggs ; the obtained balls are then cooked by frying, and then dried. Such a table, called "TABLE DES FRERES MAHIN" is available from Starbaits company </p><p id="p0143" num="0143">(http://www.starbaits.com/fr/article/table-des-freres-mahin.50.html). This table converts a cylinder into balls of the same diameter than the cylinder. Other shaping machines include the rolling machines made by Krijger and SaleckerTM, such as the ARM 0250+600. This is able to extrude a cylinder of fruit centre material and divide it into balls using a line of cutters with a crescent profile. </p><p id="p0144" num="0144">The first step is to extrude a cylinder (or much less preferred other forms like </p><p id="p0145" num="0145">parallelepiped) from the grinded mixture obtained in step 1 a), cutting it to the length suitable for the "boilies table". The second step is to place one or several cylinder on the table, and convert it into balls by an alternative translating movement of the upper side of the table, the lower side being fixed. The diameter of the boilies table channels makes the diameter of the final balls. The diameter of the extrusion cylinder must be close to the one of the boilies table, to make balling more efficient. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="28"/>-->
 To change the diameter, it is necessary to change the diameter of the hemi cylinder channels of both top and bottom part of the boilies table, as well as the diameter of the extruded cylinder. Various boilies table sizes exist, enabling ball sizes between at least from 8 to 32 mm, by step of 2 mm. </p><p id="p0146" num="0146">More generally for a solid of revolution: the grinded mixture obtained in step 1 a) is first divided in pre-forms which are sent one by one in between 2 parallel surfaces, defining a close section which has the wanted shape (a disc for a final ball shape). The surfaces are quite parallel to make a channel (a hole cylinder for a ball shape). The 2 surfaces have a differential speed (usually, 1 surface is fixed and the other moving), making the dough preform roll in between these 2 surfaces: this produces the solid of revolution. The pre-form size must be adapted to the volume defined by the 2 surfaces. Usually, several channels are in parallel, in order to make several forms at the same time. Alternatively, more conventional shapes can be made (bars), for instance by rotary molding. </p><p id="p0147" num="0147">In a particular advantageous embodiment, steps 1 a) and 1 b) are carried out between 0 and 50Ό. Usually, step 1 a) is made at a final temperat ure of 10-50Χ, preferably 20-35Ό, and step 1 b) at 0-50Χ, preferably 0 to 40Ό, advantage ously 4 to 35Ό and more preferably 20 +/- 10 Ό. </p><p id="p0148" num="0148">Therefore the taste of a fruit-based centre obtained using this process is good because fruits are not heated at high temperature during the fruit centre preparation of step 1 ). So it does not take any "cooked" fruit taste, like in jams or "pates de fruits". Furthermore, its color is preserved. </p><p id="p0149" num="0149">Softness of the fruit-based centre can come from the humectants (glycerol / sugars) and the water, but also from the fruit pieces mincing. In case no glycerol / high fruit content is used, pieces must be cut in smaller pieces to be softer / less chewy, and Aw is better to be selected in the upper ranger (0.54 for instance). 
<!-- EPO <DP n="29"/>-->
 Stickiness is critical for the forming process step 1 b). Optimum stickiness depends on the forming process and material. Stickiness must be adapted (not too low, but not too high) for the balling (or other forming) by: </p><p id="p0150" num="0150"> - careful choice of the ingredients: more water, glycerol and liquid sugars make the product stickier. Powders, including fruit powder, especially apple powder, as well as fat, decrease stickiness. The stickiness is also probably driven by the microstructure (having the glycerol outside the pieces, in the free phase, make it stickier than when infused in fruit pieces). </p><p id="p0151" num="0151"> - the process used and in particular: </p><p id="p0152" num="0152"> ■ in step 1 a : preparation of the centre: </p><p id="p0153" num="0153"> a resting time, a colder temperature (well known for its impact on glass transition Tg) and less mincing / kneading make the product less sticky.

In case a plastic boilies table is used for the forming step, the product is: </p><p id="p0162" num="0162"> - Not enough sticky when it slips and cannot form balls (this is for instance the case if some oil is sprayed on the table) </p><p id="p0163" num="0163"> - Too sticky when pieces are spread, with some product build up on the table. </p><p id="p0164" num="0164">Advantageously, after step 1 a) there is a resting time before performing step 1 b), at either room or refrigerated temperature.

By melted it is meant that the chocolate or chocolate-like composition is not in its final set and solid state. It does not infer a need for an active melting step, for example, where the composition is freshly made from the raw component ingredients. The viscosity of the melted chocolate or chocolate-like composition can be adapted to the required coating thickness, as known by the chocolate maker. </p><p id="p0171" num="0171">The chocolate or chocolate-like composition is either tempered or not. In an advantageous embodiment the real chocolate is tempered, and the chocolate-analog is pre-crystallized, even when it is not needed for decreasing the bloom risk since the chocolate is covered by the crispy pieces layer. In fact, this will ensure quicker crystallization of the chocolate / chocolate-analog coating and therefore a shorter step 4).

 In an advantageous embodiment, step 2) is carried out with a conventional enrober (preferred version) or any other suitable process known by the chocolate maker (dipping for example). Advantageously only one coating step is carried out in step 2) (less fat % in the final bite- size food product according to the present disclosure), but it is also possible to carry out 2 coatings steps for more chocolate or chocolate-like composition in the final bite-size food product according to the present disclosure.

This separation can be done by hand if necessary. </p><p id="p0174" num="0174">Step 3) of the process according to the present disclosure consists in applying a coat of individual crispy pieces on the product obtained in step 2) before the complete setting of the chocolate or chocolate-like composition layer in order to form the layer c). Several equipments can be used for carrying out step 3): </p><p id="p0175" num="0175"> - conventional rotating pan or Finn Coater (batch) : the crispy pieces are in rotation in the pan and the different centres covered with the chocolate or chocolate-like composition are added separately so that they fall directly on the crispy pieces bed and not on other centre already inside. The rotation speed must be low enough to not take the chocolate or chocolate-like composition out of the centres, but quick enough to enable to add new centres covered with the chocolate or chocolate-like composition quickly enough. When too many centres are inside the pan, they may damage each other. It is necessary to take them out, for instance with a net, which let the loose crispy pieces falling back inside the pan, and then send the centres coated with the crispy pieces to the cooling of step 4). Such 
<!-- EPO <DP n="32"/>-->
 batch equipments are sold for instance by Dumoulin (Z.I. Le Closeau, 5 rue Auguste Perdonnet, 77220 TOURNAN-EN-BRIE, FRANCE). </p><p id="p0176" num="0176">- continuous horizontal rotating pan (higher throughput): this is the preferred embodiment. It uses the same principle as the conventional pan for the rotation, but the centres coated with chocolate or chocolate-like composition enter on the upper side and the final product exit the lower side (the pan has a slight slope). The crispy pieces also enter / exit in the same way, a bit upstream of the coated centre, and make a bed, where the centres coated with chocolate or chocolate-like composition fall. The height of crispy pieces bed is controlled by the rim / flange and or the crispy pieces in feed flow rate. This height must be enough in order the centres do not transfer their melted chocolate or chocolate-like composition to the walls (which would make the crispy pieces stick to the wall, instead of only on the centre). The slope and rotation speed can be changed: this enable to spread the centres on all the available surface, and control the process time. A typical coating time is between 2 and 20 seconds, preferably in the area of 2 to 10 and 3 to 6 seconds. </p><p id="p0177" num="0177">-On a belt: in this case it is necessary to feed the belt with a bed of crispy pieces, with a thickness enough to avoid the centre covered with chocolate or chocolate-like composition to touch the belt. If the chocolate or chocolate-like composition touches the belt, then the belt becomes dirty and some crispy pieces may be stuck together or to the belt, instead of only sticking on the fruit centre. Furthermore, the centre will not be fully coated by the crispy pieces. After feeding the belt, the centre covered by the chocolate or chocolate-like composition fall from the enrober net (or eventually from the detailer if any) directly on the crispy pieces bed. Then another layer of crispy pieces is added. The whole is moved to rotate the products (for instance, by deflectors, falling on another belt), in order that all the surface of the product is coated with crispy pieces. </p><p id="p0178" num="0178">Preferably the centres coated by the chocolate or chocolate-like composition fall directly from the enrober on a crispy pieces bed and not on a "naked" belt, or on the pan walls or on other centres. This is important to better coat all the centre surface by the crispy pieces and get pieces well stuck to the centre after the chocolate or chocolate-like composition cooling. This also enables a clean and productive process: no build up of chocolate or chocolate-like composition and crispy pieces on the pan walls or on the belt, and easy 
<!-- EPO <DP n="33"/>-->
 recycling of the loose crispy pieces (clean pieces, not dirtied by the chocolate or chocolatelike composition). </p><p id="p0179" num="0179">For a center in ball shape, all these equipments are suitable, but the preferred version is the continuous horizontal rotating pan. For a center in cylinder shape, the Finn Coater may be suitable. For irregular shapes that do not rotate regularly, the coating on a belt may be more adapted. </p><p id="p0180" num="0180">In an advantageous embodiment of the process according to the present disclosure, the loose crispy pieces obtained after step 3) are separated from the bite-size product after or before the cooling step 4), advantageously before the cooling step 4). Therefore, after coating with crispy pieces, the excess of crispy pieces (free or loose) is removed by conventional sieving (pieces go through the sieve, when final products stay on it). Sieving can be done by batch, or preferably continuously (sieve or grid in slope to make the coated centres transfer to the cooling belt (step 4) at the same time; or rotating sieve for example). Sieving usually means intense shaking, but it is better to have a gentle sieving, because the chocolate or chocolate-like composition is not fully set yet. </p><p id="p0181" num="0181">In another advantageous embodiment of the process according to the present disclosure, in order to carry out step 3) the centre coated by the melted chocolate-like composition obtained after step 2) fall directly from the enrober wire mesh on a crispy pieces bed, the crispy pieces being in movement to enable a full coating. </p><p id="p0182" num="0182">The free crispy pieces are preferably recycled back to the pan / belt coating. </p><p id="p0183" num="0183">Step 4) of the process according to the present disclosure consists in cooling the food product obtained in step 3) to set the chocolate or chocolate-like composition layer b). Cooling is standard as in chocolate / confectionery process. It can be done at ambient temperature or preferably in a cooling device, preferably in a continuous cooling tunnel. Cooling time is usually between 1 and 30 minutes, preferably 1 to 10 minutes, preferably 2 to 7 minutes, depending in particular on centre temperature, type of fat used, product diameter, cooling efficiency. It can be done on a belt perforated or preferably not perforated. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="34"/>-->
 In a less preferred embodiment the centres coated by the crispy pieces are let to cool directly in the crispy pieces batch coating pan, which can be supplied with cold air. The free crispy pieces may be separated after the chocolate or chocolate-like composition solidification. This is a less productive method. </p><p id="p0184" num="0184">The process according to the present disclosure can comprises a further step 5) of packaging the bite-size food product obtained in step 4). Advantageously it is packed hermetically in a conventional way. Advantageously it is packed air tight, to maintain crispiness. Preferably transparent packs are used to see the product. To protect the product during logistics (decrease the risk of crispy pieces being taken off the centre), individual wrapping of pieces, or flow pack of a few pieces, or boxes with trays can be used. </p><p id="p0185" num="0185">The inventors have found that the preferred food product has a regular form, in particular, a 3D solid of revolution form and most preferably spherical (ball form). This regular shaping allows for the improved secure attachment of the crispy pieces, especially larger pieces. The preferred crispy pieces have a diameter (mean longest diameter) of at least 1 .6mm and preferably at least 2mm. The use of a regular shape facilitates the attachment of these pieces and this allows for a more complete covering of the centre. Moreover, the use of a humectant allows for the provision of a soft centre while maintaining a low Aw. In this way the crispiness of the crispy pieces is maintained for a long shelf life. The humectant does not spoil the taste of the product but makes the ball shaping easier. The humectant is preferably in an amount of 4-16 wt% of the centre. Preferably the centre is a fruit centre and is prepared with heating the ingredients for the centre above 60C at any point. In this way the fresh, non-cooked flavor of the fruit is maintained. Thus, a nutritionally beneficial snack can be mass produced with a long shelf life and which, importantly, tastes and appears to be healthy. Moreover, it is also advantageous to include non-gelatinised starch as discussed above due to the slower energy release that can be achieved in the final nutritional product. </p><p id="p0186" num="0186">It is desirable for the fruit centre to be minced because this provides a softer texture and a meat-grinder is ideal for providing such a texture. Especially in combination with humectants, this permits the use of a low Aw and, hence, leads to a longer shelf-life. The 
<!-- EPO <DP n="35"/>-->
 lower Aw permits the crispy pieces to be kept crispy for longer. As will be appreciated, the chocolate or chocolate-like layer of the present disclosure may be penetrated in places by the crispy pieces, especially where the pieces are larger. Accordingly, the further steps taken, as discussed above to reduce the Aw, help the crispy pieces stay crispy for longer, despite some direct contact with the centre. </p><p id="p0187" num="0187">It is also preferred for the centre to contain inclusions, such as fruit pieces. These help to ensure that the core is visually and texturally exciting for the consumer. In an advantageous embodiment of the process according to the present disclosure, the product obtained in step 2) is enrobed immediately with crispy pieces in a continuous rotating pan. Preferably, in order to avoid "double or multiple products", the centre covered with liquid chocolate or chocolate-like composition fall directly from the enrober net on a crispy pieces bed inside a continuous rotating pan. This crispy pieces bed is moving so that next incoming balls will not fall on balls already on the crispy pieces bed. Then the product obtained after step 3) is sieved to separate and recycle the free crispy pieces into the continuous rotating pan. Then the cooling step 4) is carried out in a conventional cooling tunnel. Finally the product obtained after step 4) is packed air tight rapidly, in order the crispy pieces do not pick up moisture from air. </p><p id="p0188" num="0188">In a preferred embodiment, the final product contains less than 8% by weight of Safa based on the total weight of the food product. </p><p id="p0189" num="0189">In another embodiment (not preferred) for the whole product in which the crispy pieces are not directly visible, a further step 4a) placed before or preferably after step 4) is carried out which consists in a second chocolate or chocolate-like composition coating. The coating is either very thin (to see the crispy pieces relief), or thick (to hide the crispy pieces). In the preferred case [after step 4)], a second cooling step 4b) is needed before the packaging step 5). </p><p id="p0190" num="0190">A further aspect of the present disclosure may also be described as a bite-size food product comprising: a) a plastic solid soft centre, b) a layer of a chocolate-like composition which totally coat the centre, c) a layer of individual crispy pieces, advantageously mainly cereal pieces, which fully covers the chocolate-like composition layer, the bite-size product
