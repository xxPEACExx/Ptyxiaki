When this disorder occurs without any known cause, it is called Raynaud's disease, or primary Raynaud's. When the condition occurs along with a likely cause, it is known as Raynaud's phenomenon, or secondary Raynaud's. Raynaud's disease, most common in young women (60 to 90% of reported cases), is idiopathic. Raynaud's phenomenon is secondary to other conditions, such as connective tissue disorders, obstructive arterial diseases </p><p id="p0006" num="0006"> (arteriosclerosis obliterans, thromboangiitis obliterans, thoracic outlet syndrome), neurogenic lesions, drug intoxications (ergot, methysergide), dysproteinemias, myxedema, primary pulmonary hypertension, and trauma. Raynaud's phenomenon is commonly found associated with certain rheumatic diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Secondary</p><p id="p0007" num="0007">Raynaud's may also be a result of mechanical trauma, hand-arm vibration syndrome, paraprotinemias, and certain chemicals. Patients with secondary Raynaud's associated with rheumatic diseases often have autoantibodies such as a +ANA, +anti- centromere, and/or +anti-scl-70, and visible changes in their nailfold capillary pattern. As used herein, "Raynaud's" when used without a noun encompasses both Raynaud's disease and Raynaud's phenomenon. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008"> Cold temperatures or stressful emotions can trigger attacks of either primary or secondary Raynaud's. In response to cold exposure, vasospasm in distal arteries and arterioles leads to blood being shunted from the extremities through the numerous arteriovenous anastomoses found in the digits. In response to heat, flow is decreased through these anastamoses and instead capillary flow is increased. The

 classical pattern consists of triphasic color changes of white (ischemia), blue or purple (cyanosis or deoxygenation), and red (reperfusion phase). The affected areas can throb or feel numb and tingly. With severe Raynaud's, prolonged or repeated episodes can cause prolonged pain, sores or tissue death (gangrene). </p><p id="p0009" num="0009"> Since stressful emotions can trigger attacks of either primary or secondary</p><p id="p0010" num="0010">Raynaud's, a central nervous system component is indicated as well as a peripheral vascular component. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011"> There is no accepted standard method of measuring the severity of the disease or response to therapy. The attacks of Raynaud's are difficult to elicit, and the severity of the elicited attacks varies. Since many patients do not develop the full triphasic color changes, there is some controversy over proper diagnosis of the condition,. In addition, complaints of sensation changes (cold, numbness, tingling, or pain) vary among patients these changes do not strictly correlate with the observed color differences. </p><p id="p0012" num="0012"> Many different classes of drugs have been used to treat patients with </p><p id="p0013" num="0013"> Raynaud's. Much work has focused on vasodilators. Calcium channel blockers are the most commonly used class of vasodilators, and have been shown to be effective in several studies. However, many patients do not respond or cannot tolerate these drugs because of frequent adverse effects such as headache, flushing, and hypotension. Some studies have been carried out on other drugs that can improve vasodilation including angiotensin-II type I receptor antagonist, topical nitrates, serotonin antagonists, nonselective endothelin receptor antagonist, and </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">phosphodiesterase inhibitors. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015"> Studies have shown that the potent vasodilators, prostaglandins and prostacyclin analogs, are beneficial for treating severe Raynaud's. Unfortunately, prostaglandins and prostacyclin analogs are typically administered via intravenous infusion, necessitating hospitalization for their use. A few studies have examined the use of oral prostacyclin analogs, but mixed results have been reported with one study showing benefit, another showing no benefit over placebo. There have been only a few studies on the use of topical agents directly applied to the hands for the treatment

 of Raynaud's, and while some compositions have included prostanoids, most have involved nitrate compounds, such as glyceryl trinitrate, or minoxidil. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016"> The prostacyclin analogue iloprost has been effective in secondary Raynaud's associated with scleroderma, alprostadil has been shown to be as effective as iloprost in a blind study, and was reported to improve severe digital ischemia associated with severe Raynaud's in another study. The prostanoids have been reported to have other effects besides vasodilation, including decreasing endothelial injury markers, which may imply an effect on reducing structural damage of vessel walls, decreasing neutrophil activation, inhibiting platelet aggregation, and modulating fibrinolytic activity. These agents may therefore have longer-term beneficial effects than that expected from their immediate vasodilatory effect. There have been reports of sustained benefit from use of these drugs; effects from a transdermal patch of PGE<sub>2</sub> were reported to last at least 84 hours, and intravenous infusions of these agents have been reported to last from 30 days to 12 weeks. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0018" num="0018"> In various embodiments, methods and compositions for treating Raynaud's disease and Raynaud's phenomenon are provided.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p><p id="p0035" num="0035"> Measurement Techniques </p><p id="p0036" num="0036"> Since the primary problem in Raynaud's is vasoconstriction of arteries and arterioles in the digits, with shunting of blood-flow away from the digits, various methods have been used to measure blood flow. These methods include </p><p id="p0037" num="0037">plethysmography, laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), laser Doppler imaging (LDI), temperature measurements (direct digital and thermography), and Doppler ultrasonography. There is often significant individual variability, with the range of values found for normal subjects generally overlapping the range found in Raynaud's. There is also a concern that methods such as plethysmography, laser Doppler flowmetry, direct digital temperature reading, and Doppler ultrasound that require direct patient contact with the test device may disturb the patient's circulation. </p><p id="p0038" num="0038">Additionally, it is difficult to ensure precise, reproducible probe placement, some of these methods have the additional issue of reproducibility if multiple readings are required from the same subject. In contrast, LDI and thermography allow a larger area to be examined, and do not involve direct patient contact, allowing more data to be collected, and minimizing variability related to direct patient contact or probe placement. While the flux gradient of LDI may correlate poorly with the temperature gradient measured by thermography, both methods are felt to provide useful information. Patient report measures that are commonly used include diaries of attacks, noting frequency, severity, trigger, and duration, and a visual analogue scale (VAS) to note pain or severity, as well as general state of their disease. </p><p id="p0039" num="0039"> Skin temperature, as an indirect measure of blood flow, can be affected by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Thermography should be done in a temperature and humidity controlled room to minimize the effects of these factors on </p><p id="p0040" num="0040">measurements. Large intra-patient variability can be found when the same patient is assayed at different times; and an internal comparison (ratio between distal to proximal points, or comparison between treated and placebo hands) can be used as the measure of effect. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
 Thermography has shown that patients with Raynaud's have a lower baseline skin temperature than normal subjects. Female Raynaud's patients have also been reported to have an even lower baseline than males. Several treatment studies have found that a 2°C or greater change in baseline temperature represents a significant change. Studies have reported a significant increases in mean skin temperature after intravenous administration of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), PGI<sub>2</sub>, and PGEi, oral or sublingual nifedipine or application of nitroglycerine tape (NTG) placement on the wrist of patients. </p><p id="p0041" num="0041"> Several investigators have used thermography to show that recovery from a cold challenge test is abnormal in patients with Raynaud's, with a lag in the onset of rewarming, delay in the rate of recovery, and lower temperature achieved at a set point after a cold challenge. The pattern of rewarming can also be different, with normal subjects showing rewarming beginning from the finger pulps and spreading proximally, while patients with Raynaud's have rewarming beginning at the base of the fingers and spreading distally. A two-fold increase in rewarming was seen 10 minutes into a CGRP, while a smaller, but still significant improvement in rewarming was found with fluoxetine. </p><p id="p0042" num="0042"> Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF): and laser Doppler imaging (LDI) measure moving particle density and flux, with flux used to represent blood flow. The light can penetrate about 1 mm, which permits measurements from superficial nutritional capillaries and deeper thermoregulatory vessels using different wavelengths of light. LDF requires direct contact with the study target, making it difficult to compare different sites with each other because of large variations in flux with even small positional changes, and significant intra individual variability has been found. LDI allows the entire hand to be scanned, minimizing variability between sites, but only a small number of studies have used this technique. As units reported for LDI are arbitrary, it best serves in comparison studies rather than for generating absolute standard values. A good correlation has been found between LDF and LDI. </p><p id="p0043" num="0043"> LDI has been used to assess the effect of topical glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) on finger flow in comparison to petroleum jelly or no treatment. A significant increase 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
 in flow has been reported immediately and ten minutes after topical GTN application. A significant increase in digital blood flow as measured by LDF has been reported after treatment with vardenafil. Application of a nitric oxide-generating cream to finger pulps, LDF has been reported to significantly increase flux. Removal of the gel showed a decrease in flux, but still a significant difference between NO cream and placebo. Sublingual nifedipine also has been reported to produce an increase in flux compared to placebo. Intravenous PGI<sub>2</sub> has been reported to cause an increase in LDF. A CGRP infusion caused an increase LDF, along with flushing of face and hands. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044"> Since Raynaud's attacks are typically precipitated by cold exposure, many investigators have used cold challenges to try to elicit attacks or findings typically found in attacks. However, researchers differ in their cold challenge methodology, with a range of temperatures used (0 °C, 10 °C, 12 °C, 15 °C, 16 °C, 20 °C,) for different durations of about 1 to 10 minutes. Most studies use a temperature of 15 or 16°C for 1 minute. The patient is asked to put on a thin glove that fits well, such as a latex glove, avoiding a tight fit as well as an overly loose fit that would trap air around the subject's hand. The hand is then lowered into a water bath at the specified temperature for the specified time. Some studies have specified lowering to the mid metacarpal level. After removal from the water bath, the gloves are removed, and the study measures assayed. Temperatures and/or flow are typically measured for 10-20 minutes after the cold challenge. There is significant inter individual difference, but the method is felt to be useful for therapeutic studies. </p><p id="p0045" num="0045">The Compositions </p><p id="p0046" num="0046"> Suitable topical prostaglandin compositions for the practice of preferred embodiments of the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat.
