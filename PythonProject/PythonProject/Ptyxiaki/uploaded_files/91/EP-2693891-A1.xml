In this known process, a mixture of a comminuted rice matrix material, a mi- cronutrient and an emulsifier are hydrated, kneaded, formed to strands, cut and dried. The grains obtained by this method are also referred to as reconstituted rice kernels and resemble natural rice. The publication also suggests to add vegetable fi<sup>¬</sup> bers such as cellulose, hemi-cellulose or aleurone in order to strengthen the reconstituted rice kernels. However, this process does not result in satisfying products for many kinds of fibers and is also limited to small possible ranges of weight contents of the fibers in the product. </p><p id="p0004" num="0004">In another known process, natural rice grains (i. e. rice grains which have not been reconstituted) are coated with a solution containing fibers, for example by spraying this solution onto the rice grains. However, without further precautions, these coated rice kernels obtained by this known method also have cer<sup>¬</sup> tain drawbacks. For instance, this process is only applicable for water-soluble fibers because otherwise the preparation of a solution would not be possible. This limits the choice of possi<sup>¬</sup> ble fibers. On the other hand, since these fibers are highly wa<sup>¬</sup> ter-soluble, they are washed off the rice grains when the rice is cooked in water. The fibers can therefore escape into the cooking water, so that they are not available to the consumer. </p><p id="p0005" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for the manufacture of reconstituted rice in which these prob- 
<!-- EPO <DP n="3"/>-->
lems are overcome. In particular, the process should be applica<sup>¬</sup> ble for a wide variety of fibers and/or a wide range of weight contents of the fibers in the final product. For example, at least some embodiments should be applicable for fibers which are relatively insoluble in water. Moreover, the fibers contained in the reconstituted rice should not be easily washed out/off when the rice is cooked in water. At the same time, the reconstituted rice should preferably be stable and have an acceptable shape and texture after cooking. </p><p id="p0006" num="0006">This problem is solved by a process for the manufacture of re<sup>¬</sup> constituted rice which comprises the following steps: a) providing or preparing a mixture containing comminuted </p><p id="p0007" num="0007"> rice matrix material; b) hydrating the mixture to obtain a paste and kneading the paste obtained until the rice starch is at least semi- gelatinized; c) forming the at least semi-gelatinized mass to strands and cutting them to obtain grains similar or equal to the size of rice grains; and d) drying the grains. </p><p id="p0008" num="0008">In this process, the mixture provided or prepared in step a) contains fibers and/or fibers are added during step b) . </p><p id="p0009" num="0009">The term "comminuted rice matrix material" denotes any broken, cracked or otherwise degraded rice grains which are at least partially or predominantly comminuted, including rice semolina and/or rice flour. Moreover, within the context of the present invention, the term "fiber" denotes indigestible complex carbo<sup>¬</sup> hydrates originating from the cell walls of plants. The commin<sup>¬</sup> uted rice matrix material may predominantly or entirely consist 
<!-- EPO <DP n="4"/>-->
of comminuted dehusked rice kernels, which do not contain any fibers. Alternatively, the comminuted rice matrix material may also comprise parts of the rice bran and/or the rice husk, which both contain rice fibers. </p><p id="p0010" num="0010">According to the invention, the fibers have a water absorption capacity of at least 2, preferably at least 3, most preferably at least 4. Within the context of the present invention, the wa<sup>¬</sup> ter absorption capacity is determined as follows: A sample of dry fibers is first weighed and then soaked in a tank of water having a temperature of 20 °C for 3 minutes and at a normal pressure of 101325 Pa. The fibers are then removed from the tank with the help of a sieve. Subsequently, superfluous water is al<sup>¬</sup> lowed to drip off through the sieve for 2 minutes. The wet sam<sup>¬</sup> ple containing the remaining absorbed water is then weighed again. The difference of both weights is then determined and di<sup>¬</sup> vided by the initial weight, which yields the water absorption capacity. For example, when a sample of fibers has an initial dry weight of 100 g and a final wet weight of 250 g, the water absorption capacity is (250 g - 100 g) /100 g = 1.5. Preferably, suitable fibers are not soluble in water; fibers soluble in wa<sup>¬</sup> ter would not absorb water, but completely dissolve in the water and be rinsed through the sieve. </p><p id="p0011" num="0011">The invention provides flexibility with respect to the point or time of addition of the fibers, based on the critical water ab<sup>¬</sup> sorption capacity as outlined above and below. In any case, the fibers should be added before step c) . </p><p id="p0012" num="0012">Furthermore, the process does not necessarily require that the fibers are highly water-soluble, as it is the case for the con<sup>¬</sup> ventional spraying technique discussed above. Thus, these fibers are only washed off/out to a negligible extent when the recon<sup>¬</sup> stituted rice is cooked in water. 
<!-- EPO <DP n="5"/>-->
Moreover, embedding the fibers in the matrix material is now reliably made possible. In consequence, a higher portion of the fibers remains within the reconstituted rice and is therefore available to the consumer, therefore providing a more enriched food product. </p><p id="p0013" num="0013">In step b) , the mixture may also be heated in order to enhance the semi-gelatinization . Moreover, steam and/or water may be added to the mixture in step b) . </p><p id="p0014" num="0014">The fibers may comprise corn fibers and/or pea fibers and/or rice fibers and/or white corn fibers and/or okara fibers and/or linseed fibers and/or bean fibers and/or oat fibers and/or car<sup>¬</sup> rot fibers and/or potato fibers and/or apple fibers and/or algae fibers and/or leguminose fibers and/or citrus fibers. As men<sup>¬</sup> tioned above, the comminuted rice matrix material provided or prepared in step a) may or may not contain rice fibers. A mix<sup>¬</sup> ture containing rice fibers may be provided as a direct or indi<sup>¬</sup> rect milling product of undehusked rice. Alternatively, a mix<sup>¬</sup> ture containing rice fibers may be prepared by adding rice fi<sup>¬</sup> bers to comminuted dehusked rice matrix material which is void of rice fibers. By adding rice fibers in step b) , the content of the rice fibers within the final product may be adjusted. </p><p id="p0015" num="0015">Tests have shown that the addition of rice fibers tends to pro<sup>¬</sup> duce a brown color of the final product, which is not desirable for many consumers. In order to avoid this problem, at least some of the fibers used in the process may be at least partially bleached. In particular, the fibers contained in the mixture provided or prepared in step a) and/or added during step b) may be at least partially bleached. The fibers may be bleached, for example, by treatment with a peroxide, in particular hydrogen peroxide . 
<!-- EPO <DP n="6"/>-->
In a preferable embodiment, the fibers contain or consist of pea fibers. Pea fibers were found to produce only a minor discolora<sup>¬</sup> tion of the reconstituted rice, in particular a smaller discol<sup>¬</sup> oration than that produced by rice fibers or corn fibers. </p><p id="p0016" num="0016">Advantageously, the total amount of fibers contained in the mix<sup>¬</sup> ture provided or prepared in step a) and/or added during step b) is chosen such that the total dietary fiber in the final, dried grains lies in the range between 5 % and 40 %, preferably be<sup>¬</sup> tween 10 % and 30 %, most preferably between 15 % and 25 % by weight of the dried grains. Within the scope of the present in<sup>¬</sup> vention, the total dietary fiber is determined according to the AOAC official method of analysis 985.29, for example with the Megazyme Kit obtainable from Megazyme International Ireland Lim<sup>¬</sup> ited. The person skilled in the art may easily calculate or de<sup>¬</sup> termine by routine experiments the amounts of fibers to be con<sup>¬</sup> tained in the mixture provided or prepared in step a) and/or to be added during step b) in order to obtain final, dried grains having a total dietary fiber in the above range. </p><p id="p0017" num="0017">A total dietary fiber within these ranges satisfies a compro<sup>¬</sup> mise: On the one hand, a high total dietary fiber is preferred in order to create the desired texture. On the other hand, a higher total dietary fiber would lead to an unnatural or un<sup>¬</sup> pleasant taste. </p><p id="p0018" num="0018">With preference, at least 90 %, preferably at least 95 %, most preferably at least 99 % by weight of the fibers have a length in the range from 20 μπι to 500 μπι, preferably from 50 μπι to 250 μπι. </p><p id="p0019" num="0019">The mixture prepared in step a) may be a dry mixture. This dry mixture may also contain at least one emulsifier. In some em<sup>¬</sup> bodiments, a premix may be provided in a first sub-step of step a) . The premix may contain a first amount of comminuted rice ma- 
<!-- EPO <DP n="7"/>-->
trix material and, optionally, an emulsifier. In a second sub- step of step a) , a second amount of comminuted rice matrix mate<sup>¬</sup> rial may then be added to the premix. Fibers may be added during the first sub-step and/or between the first sub-step and the second sub-step and/or during the second sub-step. </p><p id="p0020" num="0020">Step b) of hydrating and kneading may be performed in an ex<sup>¬</sup> truder. Possible operational parameters for the extruder (in<sup>¬</sup> cluding water contents, temperatures and treatment times) are disclosed in the above-mentioned publication WO 2005/053433. The disclosure of this document with respect to these parameters (including water contents, temperatures and treatment times) is hereby incorporated by reference. </p><p id="p0021" num="0021">Alternatively, it is also possible to perform at least a partial hydration and heating in a preconditioner, and then an optional further hydration, heating and kneading in an extruder. A preconditioner is advantageously used when the fibers have a high water absorption capacity. Moreover, a preconditioner helps to pretreat the starch contained in the rice in such a way that it is not damaged. In addition, the use of a preconditioner allows a shorter extruder configuration. </p><p id="p0022" num="0022">The water required for the hydration in step b) may be added to the mixture in one or several subsequent sub-steps. In particu<sup>¬</sup> lar, the water may be added in one or several sections of an ex<sup>¬</sup> truder. The addition of water in several sub-steps allows for a better control of the viscosity of the mixture or paste, in par<sup>¬</sup> ticular in an extruder. Moreover, by the addition of water in a first sub-step, the rice starch may first be substantially satu<sup>¬</sup> rated with water. The water added in a second sub-step may then be predominantly available to saturate the fibers. </p><p id="p0023" num="0023">During hydration, fibers having a high water absorption capacity absorb a high amount of the water which is added for hydration.

This water absorbed by the fibers is then not available for semi-gelatinization of the rice starch. Therefore, for fibers having a high water absorption capacity, it is advantageous when at least a portion of the fibers is added to the mixture or paste after at least a first amount of water has already been added to the mixture in step b) , in particular into an extruder. In some embodiments, the entire amount of fibers may be added to the mixture or paste after at least a first amount of water has already been added to the mixture in step b) . This is particu<sup>¬</sup> larly preferably for fibers exhibiting a high water absorption capacity. Optionally, a second addition of water may be per<sup>¬</sup> formed after the addition of the fibers. </p><p id="p0024" num="0024">Step c) of forming and cutting may be performed with equipment known per se. For step d) , any known dryer may be used which is suitable for drying conventional reconstituted rice. </p><p id="p0025" num="0025">A further aspect of the present invention is reconstituted rice comprising comminuted rice matrix material and fibers, in which the fibers have a water absorption capacity of at least 2, pref<sup>¬</sup> erably at least 3, most preferably at least 4. In particular, the reconstituted rice may be produced by a method as described above . </p><p id="p0026" num="0026">The fibers contained in the reconstituted rice may comprise corn fibers and/or pea fibers and/or rice fibers and/or white corn fibers and/or okara fibers and/or linseed fibers and/or bean fi<sup>¬</sup> bers and/or oat fibers and/or carrot fibers and/or potato fibers and/or apple fibers and/or algae fibers and/or leguminose fibers and/or citrus fibers. At least some of the fibers, in particular the rice fibers, may be at least partially bleached. </p><p id="p0027" num="0027">Preferably, the total dietary fiber within in the reconstituted rice is in the range between 5 % and 40 %, preferably between 10

% and 30 %, most preferably between 15 % and 25 % by weight of the grains . </p><p id="p0028" num="0028">A further aspect of the invention is a mixture comprising reconstituted rice as disclosed above and natural rice. It is there<sup>¬</sup> fore possible to produce and store reconstituted rice as dis<sup>¬</sup> closed above with a certain total dietary fiber. By mixing this reconstituted rice with natural rice in an appropriate mass ra<sup>¬</sup> tio, the total dietary fiber may be flexibly adjusted to indi<sup>¬</sup> vidual desires. </p><p id="p0029" num="0029">Likewise, the invention also relates to the use of reconstituted rice as disclosed above for enriching natural rice. </p><p id="p0030" num="0030">The invention will now be further explained by several embodi<sup>¬</sup> ments and examples, wherein </p><p id="p0031" num="0031">Figure 1 shows a first embodiment of a facility for manufac<sup>¬</sup> turing reconstituted rice; </p><p id="p0032" num="0032">Figure 2 shows a second embodiment of a facility for manufac<sup>¬</sup> turing reconstituted rice; </p><p id="p0033" num="0033">Figure 3 shows a third embodiment of a facility for manufac<sup>¬</sup> turing reconstituted rice; </p><p id="p0034" num="0034">Figure 4 shows a fourth embodiment of a facility for manufac<sup>¬</sup> turing reconstituted rice. </p><p id="p0035" num="0035">Figure 1 shows a first embodiment of a facility for manufactur<sup>¬</sup> ing reconstituted rice in accordance with the invention. In a dosing member 1, a premix comprising rice flour and an emulsi- fier having a weight ratio of 2:1 is obtained. In mixer 2, these components are thoroughly mixed and fed into a first hopper 3, from which the mixture is dispensed into a feedline 6. From a second hopper 4, rice flour is added at a rate between 1 and 90 kg/h. Moreover, from a third hopper 5, fibers are added. These 
<!-- EPO <DP n="10"/>-->
fibers could be corn fibers or pea fibers, for example. By the process steps described so far, a mixture containing comminuted rice matrix material and fibers is obtained. </p><p id="p0036" num="0036">This mixture is fed into an extruder 7 via feedline 6. By adding water into the extruder 7 through feedline 8, the mixture is hy- drated to obtain a paste. This paste is then kneaded within the extruder 7 until the rice starch is at least semi-gelatinized. From optional hopper 12, additional fibers may be added into the extruder 7 after hydration. As explained above, the addition of at least of portion of the fibers after the addition of water through feedline 8 is particularly suitable for fibers having a relatively high water absorption capacity: the water added through feedline 8 is available for saturating the rice starch with water, thereby allowing for a sufficient semi-gelatiniza- tion. On the other hand, when the fibers have a relatively low water absorption capacity, their entire content may be added from third hopper 5, and no fibers need to be added from hopper 12. </p><p id="p0037" num="0037">A venting 13 may be provided through a venting opening 14 in order to cool down the mass, which prevents the strands to be ex<sup>¬</sup> truded from expanding. The mass is then formed to strands by ex<sup>¬</sup> trusion through an extrusion die and cut by a cutter 9 to obtain grains similar or equal to the size of rice grains. These grains are collected by a collecting hopper 20 and transported to a fluidized bed dryer 11 via a pneumatic transport line 21, where the grains are dried. </p><p id="p0038" num="0038">The rate at which the premix is dispensed from first hopper 3 is chosen such that the amount of emulsifier lies in the range from 0.5 % to 1 % by weight of the total dry infeed. This total dry infeed is the total amount of premix from first hopper 3, rice flour from second hopper 4, fibers from third hopper 5 and, if applicable, fibers from optional hopper 12 fed directly into the 
<!-- EPO <DP n="11"/>-->
extruder 7. Moreover, the rate at which the fibers are dispensed from hopper 5 and, optionally, from hopper 12 is chosen such that the total amount of fibers lies in the range from 15 % to 25 % by weight of the total dry infeed. </p><p id="p0039" num="0039">Figure 2 shows a second embodiment of the facility. As opposed to the embodiment depicted in Figure 1, this second embodiment contains two tempering units 15 and 15' , which are connected to the extruder 7 to provide a water circulation. Moreover, additional water is also introduced through feedline 19, which is arranged downstream of the first tempering unit 15 and upstream of the second tempering unit 15' . This additional water allows to control the viscosity of the mass inside the extruder 7. </p><p id="p0040" num="0040">Moreover, by the first addition of water through feedline 8, the rice starch is substantially saturated with water, allowing for a sufficient semi-gelatinization . The water introduced through feedline 19 is then predominantly available to saturate the fi<sup>¬</sup> bers . </p><p id="p0041" num="0041">In the third embodiment shown in Figure 3, the mixture compris<sup>¬</sup> ing the rice flour, emulsifier and fibers is first directed into a preconditioner 16 (for example model BCTC obtainable from Biihler AG, 9240 Uzwil, Switzerland) , into which steam is intro<sup>¬</sup> duced through feedline 17 and/or water is introduced through feedline 18. The preconditioning helps to pretreat the starch contained in the rice without damage. From the preconditioner 16, the hydrated mixture is fed into the extruder 7. In this em<sup>¬</sup> bodiment, a single addition of water through feedline 8 suffices in order to hydrate the mixture. </p><p id="p0042" num="0042">Finally, Figure 4 shows a fourth embodiment of a facility. In contrast to Figure 3, this embodiment comprises no third hopper for adding fibers to the dry mixture. Instead, fibers are added only into extruder 7 after two hydration sub-steps, one of which occurs in the preconditioner 16 and one in the extruder 7 
<!-- EPO <DP n="12"/>-->
through feedline 8, upstream from hopper 12. For the reasons ex<sup>¬</sup> plained above, this embodiment is more suitable for fibers hav<sup>¬</sup> ing a relatively high water absorption capacity, whereas the em<sup>¬</sup> bodiment shown in Figure 3 is more adequate for fibers having a lower water absorption capacity. </p><p id="p0043" num="0043">The comminuted rice used for preparing the mixture in step a) may, for example, be milled on a hammer mill, such as on a DFZC mill obtainable from Biihler AG, 9240 Uzwil, Switzerland. This hammer mill contains conidur sieves having openings of 0.8 mm. The milled products may then be sieved (for example with a MPAR plan sifter, also obtainable by Biihler AG) to particle sizes be<sup>¬</sup> low 500 μπι before used in the process. As an emulsifier, DIMODAN HP may be used, which is a distilled monoglyceride made from edible, fully hydrogenated palm based oil. The fibers may be, for example, corn fibers, pea fibers or rice fibers. </p><p id="p0044" num="0044">The following table provides data of 9 samples of reconstituted rice prepared according to the invention (2-10) .
